978-81-224-2972-5\\n\\n\\n\\nForeword\\n\\nFOODS AND NUTRITION are essential for maintaining good health and to prevent disease. Although\\nfood occupies the first position in the hierarchical needs of man, ignorance of many basic facts relating\\nto foods and nutrition is still widespread. Consequently, various nutritional disorders for which there\\nare simple remedies such as blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency persist. Good nutrition is a\\nfunction of both economics and education. In our country, the most serious form of nutritional disorder\\nis undernutrition arising from inadequate purchasing power. However, even when purchasing power is\\nadequate to access balanced nutrition, various forms of imbalance in dietary intake occur due to lack of\\nknowledge.\\n\\nThe culinary art of which we are justifiably proud, has placed organoleptic considerations as the\\nsole criteria of excellence. The various opportunities for accomplishing balanced nutrition through\\nsynergistic interaction within the components of diet have not received the consideration they deserve.\\nI am, therefore, happy that Dr. Sumati R. Mudambi and Dr. M.V. Rajagopal have taken the trouble of\\nrevising their excellent book Fundamentals of Foods and Nutrition and added Diet Therapy in the fifth\\nedition of the book. The book covers all the important areas which ought to be taken into consideration\\nwhile promoting good nutrition in health and disease.\\n\\nThe knowledge of foods and nutrition is essential for teachers, health professionals, students of\\nhome sciences and health sciences and civil society organizations engaged in fighting endemic and\\nhidden hunger.\\n\\nThe revised edition with the addition of diet therapy will be a valuable book for the use of dietetics\\nand nursing students. It will also be a valuable guide and reference book for physicians and other health\\nprofessionals. The book of Dr. Mudambi and Dr. Rajagopal will make an important contribution to\\naccelerating the pace of achieving good nutrition in health and disease.\\n\\nThe publication of the revised version is timely.\\n\\nDr. M.S. Swaminathan\\nUnesco Cousteau Chair in Ecotechnology & Chairman,\\n\\nM.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation,\\nChennai 600113.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis page\\nintentionally left\\n\\nblank\\n\\n\\n\\nPreface to the Fifth Edition\\n\\nWE ARE HAPPY to present the 5th edition of Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy.\\nThis book is an introduction to Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy. The science courses studied at high\\nschool level are sufficient background for this course.\\n\\nThis book has consistently been used by students studying the first course in Food Science and\\nNutrition. In several universities diet therapy topics have been added in the curricula of this course.\\nTherefore diet therapy has been added in this revision. We hope it meets the altered needs of our\\nreaders.\\n\\nThe revised book is intended to meet the needs of students in a number of faculties in which\\nFoods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy is a major, elective or ancillary subject. These include Home\\nScience, Nursing, Medical and Paramedical, Agriculture, Education, Arts, Social Sciences, Community\\nHealth, Pediatrics, Environmental Health and Allied areas.\\n\\nThe contents of this edition have been revised in view of the recent developments in the area,\\nlogical sequence of subject matter, changes in the syllabi of universities and the feedback from teachers\\nand students.\\n\\nThe book covers the following aspects:\\nI. Introduction to the Study of Nutrition (Chapter 1 to 3)\\n\\nII. The Nutrients and Energy (Chapters 4 to 13)\\nIII. Meal Planning and Management (Chapters 14 to 17)\\nIV. Foods (Chapters 18 to 22)\\nV. Diet Therapy (Chapters 23 t0 36)\\n\\nAs in earlier editions, this book covers the principles of nutrition and food science and discusses\\nthe application of this knowledge in practice. In addition, in this edition it covers the principles of diet\\ntherapy, the changes in body that occur due to disease, the altered needs of the body due to disease and\\nhow to meet these through modification of the normal diet. Figures and tables have been used to help\\nvisualise practical information. The contents of the book have been developed out of continuous study\\nand teaching of these subjects and use of the knowledge in consultation with patients and use in\\npractical situations.\\n\\nEach chapter opens with an outline of its contents. Any abbreviations used are explained, and all\\nterms, which need explanation are included in the Glossary at the end of the book.\\n\\nIn the Appendices, Food Exchange Lists, Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians and\\nFood Composition Tables have been included. In addition, Table of Indian names of foods, height and\\nweight of girls and boys from birth to eighteen years and other useful information is given.\\n\\n\\n\\nviiiviiiviiiviiiviii Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nWe hope this edition helps towards making the goal of good nutrition for all, in health and disease,\\na reality.\\n\\nAny suggestions for improvement of the book in later edition are very welcome, for it indicates a\\nshared interest in the study, development and use of this fascinating subject.\\n\\nWe are grateful to the staff of New Age International (Private) Limited for their contribution to\\nthe development and completion of the fifth edition.\\n\\nJuly 2006\\nSumati R. Mudambi\\n\\nM.V. Rajagopal\\n\\n\\n\\nTHERE HAS been a long felt need for a book on the fundamentals of foods and nutrition for the\\nstudents preparing for the Higher Secondary School of Certificate Examinations of both the Central\\nand State Boards of Education. Neither do the students of nutrition in the first year of Home Science\\ncolleges have any compact Indian book on this subject. Most of the colleges usually recommend\\nAmerican textbooks because of the absence of any suitable Indian book in this area. The American\\nbooks, however, discuss the subject with reference to the needs of an economy different from ours\\nwith the result that students do not learn anything about the applications of nutrition to Indian conditions.\\n\\nThis book covers the subjects of applications of the findings of the food science and nutrition to\\nIndian conditions and at the same time discusses in simple language all the basic principles of foods and\\nnutrition. Figures and tables have been used profusely to bring home to the beginner all aspects of\\nfoods and nutrition. For the more inquisitive and interested student references to advanced books are\\ngiven in the bibliography. Through painstaking research, knowledge has been acquired about the nutrition\\nneeds of people. It is the aim of this book to motivate teachers and students to make use of this\\nknowledge and bring about  a change in the health and welfare of our people.\\n\\n(i) Basic Nutrition (Chapters 1 and 2).\\n(ii) Food Selection and Preparation (Chapters 3, 4 and 5)\\n(iii) Meal Planning (Chapters 6, 7 and 8)\\n(iv) Disorders of Malnutrition (Chapter 9)\\n(v) Food Preservation (Chapters 10 and 11)\\n(vi) Safeguarding the Food Supply (Chapters 12, 13 and 14)\\n\\nIt is hoped that this book will help our readers to understand:\\n1. Functions of foods, which supply our nutritional needs.\\n2. How to meet human need of nutrients in terms of available foods.\\n3. Prices are guides of supply and demand and not of their nutritive value.\\n4. Techniques of preparation which help us meet our needs in an enjoyable manner.\\n5. Meal planning as a tool in meeting nutritional needs of the family through acceptable enjoyable\\n\\nmeals.\\n6. Preservation as an aid to improved food availability.\\n7. Safeguarding the supply through proper selection, careful storage and preparation.\\n8. One’s responsibilities as a consumer.\\n\\nThe difficulties encountered by foods and nutrition teachers, due to lack of an appropriate Indian\\ntext, were brought to our notice by the teachers, who attended the NCERT Summer Workshops\\nconducted by one of us (SRM) at the Lady Irwin College in 1978. It prompted us to complete this\\nbook, which we had started writing, on a priority basis.\\n\\nPreface to the First Edition\\n\\n\\n\\nxxxxx Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nGreat care has been taken to ensure that no mistakes have crept into the book. However, if there\\nare any which have escaped our scrutiny, we would welcome corrections from our readers.\\n\\nWe are grateful to the Director, National Institute of Nutrition for supplying the figurs 9.2, 9.3,\\n9.4, 9.5, 9.6, and 9.7, to Messrs Voltas Limited for figures 3.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 12.4 and 14.1 and to\\nMessrs Balsara & Company for figure 12.2.\\n\\nWe are grateful to late Dr. Leela Phadnis, Professor of Foods & Nutrition, Vanasthali Vidyapeeth,\\nVanasthali, Rajasthan, Dr. S.S. Ajagaonkar, former President, All-India Institute of Diabetes, Bombay\\nand to late Dr. V. Nagarajan, Assistant Director-General, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New\\nDelhi, for their careful appraisal of the manuscript and valuable suggestions.\\n\\nWe sincerely appreciate the assistance of our sons Anand and Shyam, who corrected typescripts\\nand prepared the glossary for us.\\n\\nBombay SRM\\nSeptember, 1982  MVR\\n\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\nForeword v\\nPreface to the Fifth

part of our existence. Through the centuries we have acquired a wealth\\nof information about the use of food to ensure growth of children and youth, to maintain good health\\nthrough life, and to meet special needs of pregnancy and lactation and to use it to recover from illness.\\n\\nWhen you study food composition you will know the nutritional contribution of foods. You may\\nhave been told that certain foods are very important for maintaining good health, while others are\\nharmful. As you study the science of Foods and Nutrition, you will need to examine the ideas you have\\nabout foods very carefully and accept or reject these in the light of the knowledge you will acquire.\\nWhatever you learn in this area should be used and applied in your personal life.\\n\\nA large part of our food heritage is scientifically beneficial and needs to be retained; some aspects\\nmay need to be modified in the view of the changes in our lifestyle.\\n\\nFood is an important topic of conversations, articles in newspapers and magazines, as also of\\nadvertisements. Some of this information may be correct, but a large part of it may not be. As you learn\\n\\n\\n\\n44444 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nthis subject, you will be able to spread the knowledge gained to those around you, so that they discard\\nfalse ideas about food, which interfere with their food selection and affect their health.\\n\\nFood, nutrition and health are intimately connected aspects of our life. Let us start our study by\\ndefining these and related terms.\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nFood is that which nourishes the body. Food may also be defined as anything eaten or drunk,\\nwhich meets the needs for energy, building, regulation and protection of the body. In short, food is the\\nraw material from which our bodies are made. Intake of the right kinds and amounts of food can\\nensure good nutrition and health, which may be evident in our appearance, efficiency and emotional\\nwell-being (Figure 1.1).\\n\\nNutrition has been defined as food at work in the body. Nutrition includes everything that happens\\nto food from the time it is eaten until it is used for various functions in the body. Nutrients are components\\nof food that are needed by the body in adequate amounts in order to grow, reproduce and lead a normal,\\nhealthy life. Nutrients include water, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins. There are\\nseveral nutrients in each of the groups: proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals and vitamins; hence the\\nplural form of these words has been used. Thus there are over 40 essential nutrients supplied by food,\\nwhich are used to produce literally thousands of substances necessary for life and physical fitness.\\n\\nThe study of the science of nutrition deals with what nutrients we need, how much we need,\\nwhy we need these and where we can get them. Nutrition is the result of the kinds of foods supplied to\\nthe body and how the body uses the food supplied.\\n\\nAdequate, optimum and good nutrition are expressions used to indicate that the supply of the\\nessential nutrients is correct in amount and proportion. It also implies that the utilisation of such\\nnutrients in the body is such that the highest level of physical and mental health is maintained throughout\\nthe life-cycle.\\n\\nFigure 1.1: A well-nourished child engrossed in play.\\n\\n\\n\\nFoods, Nutrition and Health 55555\\n\\nNutritional status is the state of our body as a result of the foods consumed and their use by the\\nbody. Nutritional status can be good, fair or poor.\\n\\nThe characteristics of good nutritional status are an alert, good natured personality, a well\\ndeveloped body, with normal weight for height, well developed and firm muscles, healthy skin, reddish\\npink colour of eyelids and membranes of mouth, good layer of subcutaneous fat, clear eyes, smooth\\nand glossy hair, good appetite and excellent general health. General good health is evident by stamina\\nfor work, regular meal times, sound regular sleep, normal elimination and resistance to disease.\\n\\nPoor nutritional status is evidenced by a listless, apathetic or irritable personality, undersized\\npoorly developed body, abnormal body weight (too thin or fat and flabby body), muscles small and\\nflabby, pale or sallow skin, too little or too much subcutaneous fat, dull or reddened eyes, lustreless and\\nrough hair, poor appetite, lack of vigour and endurance for work and susceptibility to infections. Poor\\nnutritional status may be the result of poor food selection, irregularity in schedule of meals, work, sleep\\nand elimination.\\n\\nThe WHO (World Health Organization) has defined health as the ‘state of complete physical,\\nmental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity’.\\n\\nMalnutrition means an undesirable kind of nutrition leading to ill-health. It results from a lack,\\nexcess or imbalance of nutrients in the diet. It includes undernutrition and overnutrition. Undernutrition\\nis a state of an insufficient supply of essential nutrients.\\n\\nMalnutrition can be primarily be due to insufficient supply of one or more essential nutrients; or\\nit can be secondary, which means it results from an error in metabolism, interaction between nutrients\\nor nutrients and drugs used in treatment.\\n\\nOvernutrition refers to an excessive intake of one or more nutrients, which creates a stress in the\\nbodily function.\\n\\nDiet refers to whatever you eat and drink each day. Thus it includes the normal diet you consume\\nand the diet people consume in groups (hostel diet). Diet may also be modified and used for ill persons\\nas part of their therapy (therapeutic diets).\\n\\nNutritional care is the use of nutritional knowledge in planning meals and the preparation of\\nthese meals in an acceptable and attractive manner to feed people. It involves assessment of the exiting\\nmeal patterns and improving these in an acceptable manner. While the nutritional plan may be general\\nfor a group of people, the actual execution is individualized to suit the person’s needs and background.\\nThus one has to use a lot of ingenuity to succeed in making nutritional care effective in practical terms.\\n\\nHealth the word health refers to the condition of the body, good health not only implies freedom\\nfrom disease, but physical, mental and emotional fitness as well.\\n\\nFunctions of Food\\n\\nPhysiological functions of food. The first function of the body is to provide energy. The body\\nneeds energy to sustain the involuntary processes essential for continuance of life, to carry out\\nprofessional, household and recreational activities, to convert food ingested into usable nutrients in the\\nbody, to grow and to keep warm. The energy needed is supplied by the oxidation of the foods consumed.\\n\\nThe foods we eat become a part of us. Thus one of the most important functions of food is\\nbuilding the body. A newborn baby weighing 2.7-3.2 kg can grow to its potential adult size of 50–60\\nkg if the right kinds and amounts of food are eaten from birth to adulthood. The food eaten each day\\nhelps to maintain the structure of the adult body, and to replace worn out cells of the body.\\n\\n\\n\\n66666 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThe third function of food is to regulate activities of the body. It includes regulation of such\\nvaried activities as:\\n\\n• Beating of the heart\\n• Maintenance of the body temperature\\n• Muscle contraction\\n• Control of water balance\\n• Clotting of blood\\n• Removal of waste products from the body\\n\\nThe fourth function of food is to improve our body’s resistance to disease.\\nThe Social Functions of Food. Food has always been a central part of our social existence. It\\n\\nhas been a part of our community, social, cultural and religious life. Special foods are distributed as a\\nbenediction or prasad in the religious functions in homes, temples and churches. Feasts are given at\\nspecific stages of life such as birth, naming ceremony, birthdays, marriages, etc. Most of the religious\\nfestivals also call for feasts and feeding of specific segments of the population. Certain menus are\\nassociated with most of these feasts in each region.\\n\\nFood has been used as an expression of love, friendship and social acceptance. It is also used as\\na symbol of happiness at certain events in life, for example, pedhas are distributed to announce success\\nin examinations, or the birth of a baby; laddus are associated with the celebration of Deepavali and\\nmarriages, cakes are associated with Christmas and birthdays and tilgul with sankranti the festival of\\nfriendship.\\n\\nAs food is an integral part of our social existence, this function is important in daily life.\\nRefreshments served at get-togethers or meetings create a relaxed atmosphere. The menu for such\\nget-together should bring the people together, rather than divide them. This basic aspect should be\\nconsidered in planning menus for such occasions (Figure 1.2).\\n\\nFigure 1.2:  Functions of food.\\n\\nGrowth and Renewal\\n\\nRegulation\\n\\nEnergy\\n\\nLove and Security Food Party\\n\\n\\n\\nFoods, Nutrition and Health 77777\\n\\nThe Psychological Functions of Food. In addition to satisfying physical and social needs, food\\nmust satisfy certain emotional needs. These includes a sense of security, love and attention. Thus\\nfamiliar foods make us feel secure. Anticipating needs and fulfilling these are expressions of love and\\nattention. These sentiments are the basis of the normal attachment to the mother’s cooking.\\n\\nSharing of food is a token of friendship and acceptance. In a friendly gathering we try unfamiliar\\nfoods and thus enlarge our food experiences. It must be noted that even a nutritionally balanced meal\\nmay not be satisfying to the individual, if the foods included are unfamiliar or distasteful to him/her.\\nWith time and repeated experience, strange foods become familiar and new tastes are formed.\\n\\nThese aspects are important in food acceptance and must be considered in planning meals, which\\nare not only nutritionally adequate, but also enjoyable for the group for whom they are intended.\\n\\nFunctions of Nutrients\\n\\nThe foods which we use daily include rice, wheat, dal, vegetables, fruits, milk, eggs, fish, meat,\\nsugar, butter, oils, etc. These different foods are made up of a number of chemical components called\\nnutrients. These are classified according to their chemical composition.\\n\\nEach nutrient class has its own function, but the various nutrients must act in unison for effective\\naction. The nutrients found in foods are — carbohydrates, proteins, fats, minerals, vitamins and water.\\nFibre is also an essential component of our diet. The functions of nutrients are given below.\\n\\nCarbohydrates: Starch found in cereals and sugar in sugarcane and fruits are examples of\\ncarbohydrates in foods. The chief function of carbohydrates is to provide energy needed by our body.\\nThose not used immediately for this purpose are stored as glycogen or converted to fat and stored, to\\nbe mobilised for energy supply when needed.\\n\\nFats: Oils found in seeds, butter from milk, and lard from meat, are examples of fats found in\\nfoods. Fats are concentrated sources of energy, carriers of fat soluble vitamins and a source of essential\\nfatty acids. If excess fats are taken in the diet, these are stored as fat reserves in the body. Energy taken\\nin excess of body needs, is stored as fat in the body.\\n\\nProteins: Casein from milk, albumin in egg, globulins in legumes and gluten in wheat, are examples\\nof proteins occurring in foods. The main function of protein is the building of new tissues and maintaining\\nand repair of those already built. Synthesis of regulatory and protective substances such as enzymes,\\nhormones and antibodies is also a function of food proteins. About 10 per cent of the total energy is\\nsupplied by proteins in the diet. Protein, when taken in excess of the body’s need, is converted to\\ncarbohydrates and fats and is stored in the body.\\n\\nMinerals: The minerals calcium, phosphorus, iron, iodine, sodium, potassium and others are\\nfound in various foods in combination with organic and inorganic compounds. Minerals are necessary\\nfor body-building, for building of bones, teeth and structural parts of soft tissues. They also play a role\\nin regulation of processes in the body, e.g., muscle contraction, clotting of blood, nerve stimuli, etc.\\n\\nVitamins: Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and also water-soluble vitamins C and B group are\\nfound in foods. These are needed for growth, normal function of the body and normal body processes.\\n\\nWater: We get water in foods we eat and a major part from the water we drink as such and as\\nbeverages. Water is an essential part of our body structure and it accounts for about 60 per cent of our\\nbody weight. Water is essential for the utilisation of food material in the body and also for elimination of\\nfood waste. It is a regulator of body processes such as maintenance of body temperature.\\n\\n\\n\\n88888 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nAll individuals need the same nutrients for the same body function. The only variation is in the\\namounts of each nutrient required according to age, size, activity, etc. For example, all persons need\\nenergy for work, but a man, who carries loads may need more energy than a man, who works in an\\noffice at a desk job.\\n\\nAs you know, we get the nutrients from the foods and the beverages we consume. Most foods\\ncontain the nutrients in varying amounts. Let us understand the nutrient composition of the foods we\\nuse everyday.\\n\\nFood Composition\\n\\nMost food contain more than one nutrient. The nutrient contents of foods have been determined\\nby analysing these in the laboratory. The composition of over 650 Indian foods has been determined.\\nOf these, the nutritive value of about 160 foods is presented in the Appendix F.\\n\\nThe food composition tables give the concentration of nutrients in 100 g of the edible portion\\n(E.P.) of the food. Therefore it is important to know how much of the food purchased is edible. In\\nsome foods, such as milk, butter, sugar, the edible portion is 100 per cent. In fruits and vegetables, it\\nvaries from 65 per cent in bananas to 98 per cent in tomatoes.\\n\\nThe values for nutrients given in food composition tables are averages of the results obtained by\\nanalysing a large number of samples of each food. Therefore the figures in such tables give a fairly\\ngood idea of the composition of each food.\\n\\nFoods are grouped in the food value tables, on the basis of the plant part from which the food is\\nderived, for example, seeds, roots, leaves, fruits, etc. Animal foods are grouped on the basis of species\\nand the product used.\\n\\nIt is interesting to note that there are inherent similarities in the composition of foods in each\\ngroup. In Table 1.1, the composition of various foods has been presented to illustrate this point. For\\nexample, the protein content of cereals varies from 7 to 12, and that of dals and legumes from 17 to 25\\nper cent. This information has important applications in practical usage of tables. It is possible to\\npredict the overall nutrient content of combinations used, if we know the amounts of individual foods\\nused. If the composition of a particular food is not found in the tables, you can roughly predict its\\nnutrient contribution, by knowing the group to which it belongs.\\n\\nYou may observe from Table 1.1, that cereals and dals do not contain vitamins A and C. Therefore\\nyou will realise how important it is to include vegetables and fruits, which are rich source of these two\\nvitamins, in our daily menu of cereals and dal. Most of the vegetablres and fruits, as you will observe\\nfrom Table 1.1, are low in calories. Oils, fats and sugars are mainly sources of calories. Thus you get\\nan idea of the contribution of various foods by studying Table 1.1.\\n\\nMost of the analytical work on Indian foods was carried out in various laboratories under the\\nauspices of Indian Council of Medical Research. A compilation of results is published as the Nutritive\\nValue of Indian Foods, by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). A number of new varieties\\nof food with high contents of certain nutrients, have been developed at research centres under the\\nauspices of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. You get a number of these foods in the market\\nand use these in your dietary. The nutritive value of these new varieties of foods need to be included in\\nthe book on Nutritive Value of Indian Foods. There are two International Food Value tables published by\\n\\n\\n\\nFoods, Nutrition and Health 99999\\n\\nthe Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO) (please refer to these books, which are listed in Further\\nReading at the end of this book).\\n\\nIt is good to remember that the nutritive value of natural foods does not vary a great deal for a\\nparticular variety of the same food from one country to another. But there is a great variation in the\\ncomposition of prepared foods such as bread, biscuits, cakes, etc., due to variation in recipes and the\\nbasic ingredients used from one region to another.\\n\\nTable 1.1: Food Composition at a Glance1\\n\\n(Approx.

A.\\n\\nFood Exchange Lists\\n\\nIn 1950, the American Diabetes Association and the American Dietetic Association collaboratively\\ndeveloped a system of food lists to help diabetic patients to select foods in their diets. Similar food lists\\n\\nFoods Moisture\\n\\n\\n\\n1010101010 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nwere prepared in other countries to help diabetics to choose their foods. In India also food lists were\\nprepared based on the foods available and our meal pattern. Since India is a large country there are\\nthree major agencies that have evolved their food exchange lists. These agencies are dietetic departments\\nof major regional hospitals, the Home Science colleges, which train dietetic students, and the dietetics\\ndepartment of the National Institute of Nutrition. These are presented in Appendix B.\\n\\nEach of the list includes a group of foods, which supply about the same calories in the portion\\nindicated. Each food choice within a list is called an exchange. It represents an amount of food that has\\nabout the same macronutrient value as other foods in the same group.\\n\\nThe exchange lists are very useful tools in diet planning in hospitals and in personal diet management\\nin the home.\\n\\nNutrient Density\\nIt refers to the quantity of one or more nutrients supplied by a food in reference to its calorie\\n\\ncontent. For example, if one compares the protein content of isocaloric portions of dal, bread and milk,\\none can see that dal has the highest nutrient density for protein, milk next and bread the least.\\n\\nCalories Protein\\nDal 85 5.5\\nMilk 85 4.0\\n\\nBread 85 2.4\\n\\nThus nutrient density is an important aspect to be considered in selection of foods, especially in\\ndiets of children, pregnant women, nursing mothers and in therapeutic diets for patients.\\n\\nHow will you be a responsible nutrition student?\\nFirst, use what you learn in nutrition and benefit yourself. It will help you to look better, feel\\n\\nbetter and work effectively. By practising what you learn, you will set a good example for others.\\nSecondly take care of nutrition of your family. Help the children in the family to develop good\\n\\nfood habits, the adults to make good food choices in eating and seniors to meet their changed needs.\\nThirdly, as a professional you will be able to help people, who seek your advice, to make appropriate\\n\\nchanges to improve their food choices to improve their well-being.\\nLastly, as a member of the community, you can influence the choice of foods served in social\\n\\nevents.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

It is made of a complex structure of cells,\\ntissues and organs. How does this change from food to our body structure occur? All the changes that\\noccur in the food from the time we eat it, to its use in the body and discarding of the waste matter are\\nknown as metabolism. One can describe metabolism of each nutrient separately to ensure ease of\\nunderstanding. But actually it occurs in a correlated systematic manner.\\n\\nBasic concepts of biology and chemistry need to be understood in the study of nutrition. Let us\\nreview these.\\n\\n\\n\\n1212121212 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nConcepts in Biology: The study of nutrition begins with the cell, the basic unit of our body. All\\nthe nutrition processes, which we refer to as metabolism, take place in the cell. Metabolism includes\\nboth anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism involves synthesis of compounds needed for use in the\\nbody. Breakdown of complex substances to simpler ones is known as catabolism. Thus cells are able\\nto take up nutrients, synthesise substances they need and eliminate wastes. The energy release and its\\nutilisation occurs in the cell.\\n\\nThere are many kinds of cells in the body, each type specialises in carrying out certain functions\\nrequired by the body.\\n\\nCells are grouped together to form a tissue. Muscle, nerve, epithelial and connective tissue are\\nexamples of various tissues.\\n\\nTwo or more tissues are combined to form an organ, which carries out a specific function. Heart,\\nlungs and kidneys are examples of organs.\\n\\nCells are made up of several parts. Each part has an appropriate structure and a specific function.\\nTwo main parts of the cell are the nucleus and the protoplasm, which surrounds the nucleus and is\\ncalled cytoplasm (Figure 2.1).\\n\\nFigure 2.1: Diagram of a typical cell based on electron micrographs. (Adapted from “The Living Cell” by J.\\nBracket. Copyright © 1961 by Scientific American, Inc. All rights reserved.)\\n\\n\\n\\nDigestion, Absorption and Utilisation of Nutrients 1313131313\\n\\nThe nucleus controls the functions of the cell; the metabolic activities of the cell are carried out\\nby the cytoplasm.\\n\\nThe deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the cell nucleus contains the pattern for each of the different\\nproteins in the body. The ribonucleic acid (RNA) directs the actual protein synthesis in the ribosomes,\\nusing the information stored in the DNA. This process, which is directed and controlled by DNA, is the\\nkey to nutrition.\\n\\nAll the components, which form nutrients, come from food. Our genes determine the nutrients\\nthat can be synthesised in the body and those which need to be provided preformed in the food.\\n\\nThe small channels in the cytoplasm, called endoplasmic reticulum, transport nutrients and their\\nmetabolites throughout the cytoplasm. The enzymes, which function in metabolism, are found in the\\nmembranes surrounding the channels.\\n\\nThe mitochondria and lysosomes are also present in the cytoplasm. Mitochondria release the\\nenergy provided by the carbohydrates, fats and proteins and transfer it to an energy acceptor (ATP).\\nThe ATP transfers the energy as needed wherever work is being done. Therefore the mitochondria are\\nknown as the ‘power plants’ of the cell.\\n\\nLysosomes contain enzymes, which function in the breakdown of proteins and other compounds.\\nLysosomes help to digest foreign matter that may have entered the cell and thus protect the body from\\ntheir harmful effects.\\n\\nChemistry: Our body and the food that nourishes it are made of chemical elements. Therefore\\nknowledge of the chemical elements and their behaviour is basic to the study of nutrition.\\n\\nElements: Elements are fundamental units of matter, which have characteristic properties. The\\nPeriodic Table contains all the elements. Of the 106 known elements, 92 occur in nature, the rest are of\\nsynthetic origin. Examples of elements are oxygen, carbon and iron.\\n\\nAtoms: The smallest constituent part of an element is an atom. There are smaller particles, which\\nare parts of an atom. The proton (+vely charged) and neutron (uncharged) particle are located in the\\nnucleus of the atom. In the shells (orbits) around the nucleus, the electron, a negatively charged\\nparticle is found.\\n\\nAtoms of one element can combine with atoms of another element to form a compound. For\\nexample, water contains two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen (H2O).\\n\\nMolecule: Chemical elements exist as molecules, a basic unit, which can be made up of atoms of\\none or more elements. Thus we have a molecule of oxygen (O2) with two atoms of oxygen, while\\nsodium chloride (NaCl) contains one atom of sodium and one atom of chlorine.\\n\\nIon: An electrically charged atom, group or molecule is called an ion. A positively, charged ion is\\ncalled a cation, and a negatively charged one an anion. K+ is an example, of a positive atom and Cl– is\\na negative atom; potassium chloride (KCl) is a neutral compound.\\n\\nIsotopes: Some elements have isotopes, that is they exist in two forms, with two different\\natomic weights; for example, the atomic weight of carbon is 12, its isotope has an atomic weight of 14\\n(14C). The 14C isotope of carbon is naturally radioactive.\\n\\nAcids, Bases, pH: A chemical compound, which when dissolved in water yields hydrogen ions\\n(H+), is an acid. There are two types of acids, inorganic acids and organic acids. Hydrochloric, sulfuric\\nand phosphoric are inorganic acids. Organic or carboxylic acids contain one or more carboxyl groups\\n(COOH) in their molecule. Fatty acids and amino acids are important organic acids in nutrition.\\n\\nHydrogen ion concentration is the amount of hydrogen ion (H+) per unit volume of an aqueous\\n(water) solution. It is referred to as pH.\\n\\n\\n\\n1414141414 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nSome Chemical Reactions: Some chemical reactions, which occur in biological systems, are\\nlisted here.\\n\\n1. Salt formation: When an acid and a base react, salt is one of the products formed.\\nHCl + KOH → KCl + H2O\\nacid + base → salt + water\\n\\n2. Ester formation: When an organic acid reacts with an alcohol, an ester is formed. When a\\nfatty acid reacts with glycerol, a fat (an ester) is formed.\\n\\n3. Oxidation-reduction: Oxidation is always accompanied by a reduction, in which electrons\\nare transferred from one atom to another. The atom that gives up the electron is oxidised, the\\none that receives the electron is reduced. Thus ferric ion is reduced by vitamin C to ferrous\\nform.\\n\\nFe+++ + reduced form of vit. C →\\nFe++ + oxidised form of vitamin C\\n\\n4. Hydrolysis: The reaction of water with another compound, with uptake of a molecule of\\nwater, is known as hydrolysis. The breakdown of carbohydrates and fats in digestion is an\\nexample of hydrolysis.\\n\\n5. Phosphorylation: is a chemical reaction in which a phosphate group is introduced into an\\norganic compound. The formation of ATP from ADP is an example of this reaction.\\n\\n6. Synthesis: When a complex substance is formed from simpler substances by a series of\\nreactions it is known as synthesis. Synthesis of proteins from amino acids is a good example\\nof this reaction.\\n\\n7. Degradation: Complex substances are gradually broken down to simpler ones. The\\nbreakdown of glycogen to glucose is an example of degradation reaction.\\n\\nUse of Food in the Body\\n\\nThe use of food in the body involves three processes — digestion, absorption and utilisation of\\nnutrients in the body.\\n\\nDigestion is the process, which releases many nutrients in the forms the body can use, by\\nbreaking up food in the intestinal tract.\\n\\nAbsorption is the process which carries these nutrients into the circulation system and delivers\\nthem to the cell.\\n\\nUtilisation. Cell is the functional unit of life. Hence a large number of the chemical reactions in\\nthe cell utilise the nutrients absorbed to produce materials needed for our existence.\\n\\nMechanical processes involved in digestion include chewing of food, swallowing of food, churning\\naction in the stomach and rhythmic contraction of the intestinal tract.\\n\\nChewing of food reduces the food particles in size, mixes these with saliva and dilutes it with\\nwater, so that it is easy to swallow. The food swallowed is mixed with enzymes and acid by the\\nchurning action in the stomach. Further the rhythmic contraction of the intestine, help to break the\\nfood into small particles and move the food mass forward through the digestive tract (Figure 2.2).\\n\\nChemical reactions in digestion process: The first reaction is hydrolysis or splitting with the\\nhelp of water. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins break up with the addition of water into smaller molecules,\\nwhich the tissues can use.\\n\\n\\n\\nDigestion, Absorption and Utilisation of Nutrients 1515151515\\n\\nFigure 2.2: The digestive tract.\\n\\nThe chemical reactions are accelerated by enzymes, which are secreted in the mouth, stomach\\nand small intestine. Enzymes are living catalysts, that increase the speed of biological reactions, without\\nbeing a part of the compound formed. The enzymatic reactions, which take place in the digestion\\nprocess, are presented in Table 2.1.\\n\\nAs you may know, enzymes are proteins by nature. Their name indicates substance on which\\nthey can act, for example, sucrase acts on sucrose. Enzymes are specific in their actions. An enzyme,\\nwhich hydrolyses protein, will not act on starch. Each enzyme acts optimally at a certain pH, e.g.,\\namylase acts only in alkaline medium.\\n\\nSome enzymes need another group, known as a coenzyme, to be attached to it to aid their\\nfunction. For example, B-vitamin serve as coenzymes in the reactions, which release energy from\\nglucose. In enzyme reactions, mineral elements are essential as cofactors. Thus normal body metabolism\\nis dependent on the presence of appropriate enzymes, coenzymes and cofactors specific to each\\nreaction.\\n\\nThe digestive enzymes are only one group of a large number that are essential to regulate body\\nprocesses. Other enzymes are present in various tissues of the body and help in the utilisation of food\\nthat has been absorbed.\\n\\nCarbohydrates\\n\\nThe digestion process begins with chewing the food in the mouth. The enzyme ptyalin (salivary\\namylase) starts the digestion of starch in the mouth. It hydrolyses starch to dextrins, isomaltose and\\nmaltose in neutral or alkaline pH in the mouth. The food tastes sweet due to these products of hydrolysis.\\nThe activity of amylase continues in its movement from the mouth to the upper part of the stomach.\\nBut as soon as the food mass comes in contact with hydrochloric acid secreted there, this action\\nceases. Very little digestion of carbohydrate occurs in the stomach as the pH is unfavourable.\\n\\n\\n\\n1616161616 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nEnzyme Optimum pH Substrate\\n\\nThe food mixed with gastric juice forms a semi-fluid mass called chyme. It takes about three to\\nfive hours to form chyme. Small portion of chyme are released through the pyloric sphincter into the\\nduodenum, the first part of the small intestine.\\n\\nThe small intestine is so named because of the small diameter of its tube. It is about 20 ft long.\\nMost of the digestive activity takes place in its three compartments namely the duodenum, the jejunum\\nand ileum.\\n\\nCarbohydrate digestion occurs almost completely in the small intestine, mainly in the duodenum.\\nPancreatic amylase breaks starches into maltose and dextrins. The maltase from mucosal cells\\nbreaks down maltose to glucose. The brush border, on the surface of the epithelial cells lining the\\nintestines, is the site of this enzyme action.\\n\\nThe enzymes sucrase, lactase, maltase, and isomaltase, found on the outer cell membranes of\\nthe intestines, act on the sugars sucrose, lactose, maltose and isomaltose respectively. The\\nmonosaccharides formed—glucose, galactose and fructose—pass through the mucosal cell and via the\\ncapillary into the blood stream. These are carried to the liver by the portal vein.\\n\\nTable 2.1: Enzymatic Reactions in Digestion\\n\\nPlace of Products of\\nAction Reaction\\n\\nMouth Salivary amylase 7.0 Cooked starch Dextrins, maltose\\n(Ptyalin)\\n\\nStomach Pepsin (protease) 2.0 Proteins Polypeptides\\nRennin 6.0–6.5 Milk, casein Calcium caseinate\\nLipase 7.0 Emulsified fats Fatty acids, glycerol\\n\\nSmall Pancreatic Juice\\nIntestine Trypsin (Protease) 8.0–9.0 Proteins Polypeptides,\\n\\nsome amino-acids\\nLipase 7.0 Fats Di and mono-\\n\\nglycerides, fatty\\nacids, glycerol\\n\\nAmylase 7.1 Starch Maltose\\nIntestinal Juice\\nPeptidases 8.0 Peptones, Amino acids\\n(Erepsin) Polypeptides\\nSucrase 5.0–7.0 Sucrose Glucose, fructose\\nMaltose 6.7–7.2 Maltose Glucose\\n\\n(2 molecules)\\nLactase 5.4–6.0 Lactose Glucose, galactose\\n\\n1. pH is expressed as the negative logarithm of ‘hydrogen ion concentration’. The pH of water is 7; the acids\\nhave pH less than 7 and alkalies have pH above 7.\\n\\nSome glucose is stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, the rest is transported to tissues to\\nbe used for their activities. Fructose and galactose are converted to glucose in the liver.\\n\\n\\n\\nDigestion, Absorption and Utilisation of Nutrients 1717171717\\n\\nCellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and other forms of carbohydrate, which are collectively known as\\nfibre, are not split by human amylases. These are excreted in the faeces.\\n\\nProteins\\n\\nDigestion of proteins starts in the stomach, which serves as a storehouse, where some protein\\nhydrolysis begins. Milk is clotted by a special enzyme rennin and acid is added.\\n\\nGastric juice, which is secreted by the stomach, contains hydrochloric acid, pepsin, rennin,\\nmucin and other substances.\\n\\nHydrochloric acid has several important functions: (1) it swells the proteins, thus increasing their\\nsurface area for enzyme action, (2) it converts the inactive pepsinogen to the enzyme pepsin, (3) it\\nprovides the acid medium necessary for the action of pepsin, (4) it provides acidic pH for solution of\\ncalcium and iron salts, (5) it reduces or destroys the activity of many pathogens (harmful bacteria)\\npresent in the food.\\n\\nPepsin is the only proteolytic enzyme, which is able to digest collagen, the main protein in connective\\ntissue. Pepsin, a protease in the gastric juice, splits proteins to polypeptides. It also digests the milk\\ncurds formed by the enzyme rennin. The contribution of the stomach to the total process of protein\\ndigestion is small, as most protein digestion occurs in the duodenum.\\n\\nAs soon as the chyme enters the duodenum, it stimulates the intestinal mucosa to release an\\nenzyme enterokinase, which converts inactive trypsinogen into active trypsin. Trypsin activates\\nother proteolytic enzymes—chymotrypsin and carboxypolypeptidases. These enzymes breakdown\\nintact protein and with the help of peptidases continue the breakdown until small polypeptides and\\namino acids are formed. The last phase of protein digestion also occurs in brush border, in which\\npeptidases hydrolyse di- and tri-peptides into constituent amino acids. But some intact peptides do\\nescape hydrolysis and enter the portal circulation.\\n\\nThe amino acids released are absorbed via distinct active transport systems. Absorbed amino\\nacids and peptides are transported via the portal vein to the liver to be released into the general circulation.\\n\\nBy the time it reaches the jejunum, almost all the protein is absorbed. Only one per cent of\\ndigested protein is excreted in the faeces.\\n\\nSome amino acids, which remain in the epithelial cells, are used in the synthesis of new cells and\\nintestinal enzymes. The endogenous protein released internally (by breaking down of epithelial cells and\\nintestinal secretions) is digested and absorbed from the small intestine along with that ingested in the\\ndiet.\\n\\nLipids\\n\\nThe stomach lipase does act on emulsified fats in milk, cream, butter and egg yolk, but most of\\nthe hydrolysis of fats takes place in the small intestine.\\n\\nAs soon as the food enters the duodenum, the gall bladder releases some bile and the pancreas\\nsecrete enzyme-rich juices. These fluids enter the duodenum through a common duct. Bile is a secretion\\ncomposed of bile acids, bile pigments, cholesterol, lecithin and many other compounds. About a liter of\\nbile is secreted daily due to the stimulus of food in the duodenum.\\n\\nThe bile, which is manufactured by the liver, helps to\\n• emulsify fat particles, which increases surface area and improves enzyme action.\\n• neutralise the acid chyme and provide the alkaline pH necessary for the action of the intestinal\\n\\nenzymes.\\n\\n\\n\\n1818181818 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThe pancreatic juices contain trypsin, lipase and amylase, which act upon all components of\\nfoods. Thus proteins are broken down by trypsin into amino acids. Large sugar molecules are changed\\nto simple sugars by action of amylase and lipase acts on glycerides and reduces these to fatty acid and\\nglycerol.\\n\\nThe products of fat digestion inhibit the digestion process. The digested meal must be removed\\nfrom the duodenum over a period of time, to permit digestion to proceed. Hence a fatty meal may\\nremain up to four hours or more in the stomach. Thus there is a feeling of satiation after a fatty meal.\\n\\nMicelles, a combination of free fatty acids, monoglycerides and bile salts, facilitate the passage\\nof lipids through the aqueous environment of the intestinal lumen to the brush border. The bile salts are\\nthen released from the lipid complex and return 3 to 15 times to carry more lipids across the membrane,\\ndepending on the amount of food ingested.\\n\\nThe fatty acids and monoglycerides are reassembled into new triglycerides in the mucosal cell.\\nChylomicrons are formed by surrounding a combination of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids\\nwith a beta-lipoprotein coat. Chylomicrons are transported by lymphatic vessels into the blood stream\\nand further on to the liver. The triglycerides are transported to adipose tissue for metabolism and\\nstorage.\\n\\nCholesterol is hydrolysed by pancreatic cholesterol esterase from ester form and absorbed in\\nthe same manner as lipids.\\n\\nThe fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K are also absorbed in a similar fashion. Some forms of the\\nvitamins A, E and K and carotene do not need bile acids for their absorption.\\n\\nNormally 97 per cent of ingested fat is absorbed into lymph vessels. Fatty acids of 10 carbons or\\nless, due to shorter length and increased solubility, do not need bile salts and micelle formation for their\\nabsorption and can be absorbed directly into the mucosal cell. From the mucosal cell these acids go\\ndirectly via the portal vein to the liver, without esterification.\\n\\nThis is clinically a very useful quality of medium-chain fatty acids. Those patients, who cannot\\nmetabolise usual long-chain fatty acids in dietary fat, due to lack of bile salts or some other problem,\\ncan be fed triglycerides of medium-chain fatty acids (C8 and C10). These can be utilised directly.\\n\\nThe digestive process is also aided by friendly bacteria which live in the intestinal tract. They help\\nin hydrolysing food and manufacture some of the nutrients (e.g., vitamin K, folic acid and some B-\\ncomplex vitamins).\\n\\nOther Nutrients\\n\\nVitamins and water pass unchanged from the small intestine into blood by passive diffusion.\\nMineral absorption, which is more complex, occurs in three stages. In the first stage, chemical\\n\\nreactions occur in the stomach and intestines, which are affected by the pH of the mix. In the second\\nstage, these are carried across the membrane into intestinal mucosal cell. In the third stage, minerals\\nare transported into the blood stream or are bound within the cell.\\n\\nImportant interactions occur between minerals in the gastrointestinal tract, which affect the\\namount that is absorbed.\\n\\nThere is simultaneous absorption of vitamins, minerals and fluids through the intestinal mucosa.\\nAbout 8 liters of fluids move to and from across the membrane of the gut to keep the nutrients in\\nsolution. The current understanding of the sites and routes of absorption of nutrients is depicted in\\nFigure 2.3.\\n\\n\\n\\nDigestion, Absorption and Utilisation of Nutrients 1919191919\\n\\nFigure 2.3: Gastrointestinal tract-sites of secretions and absorption.\\n\\nFactors Affecting Digestion\\nSeveral factors affect the digestion process. These include:\\n1. Psychological factors, which play an important role in food acceptance, ingestion and digestion.\\n\\nIf one likes the sight, smell and taste of food, it increases secretions of saliva, stomach juices\\nand motility of gastrointestinal tract. Even the thought of food increases these secretions.\\nOn the other hand, if these are not liked, it depresses the secretions.\\n\\n2. Generally well cooked foods are more digestible than raw foods.\\n3. Sound teeth to bite, cut and tear food into smaller pieces helps digestion, absence of molars,\\n\\nincisors and/or canine teeth affects the person’s ability to grind the food adversely and hence\\ndigestion is poor.\\n\\n\\n\\n2020202020 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n4. Sufficient supply of water to dilute the food, permits effective movement through the digestive\\ntract and increases the surface area for efficient enzymatic breakdown.\\n\\n5. Sufficient bulk (fibre) helps to maintain normal forward movement.\\n6. Normal secretion of enzymes, bile, hydrochloric acid aids the chemical splitting of food\\n\\ncomponents to small absorbable units.\\n7. The presence of friendly bacteria in the intestinal tract helps digestion.\\n8. Relaxation of body permits the processes involved in digestion to occur normally. Any\\n\\npsychological stress, which makes a person tense, interferes with the digestive process by\\nupsetting the occurrence of the normal secretions mentioned above.\\n\\nRole of Large Intestine\\n\\nLarge intestine consists of cecum, colon, rectum and the canal and is about 5 feet long.\\nAbout 500 to 1,000 ml of water in the chyme enters the colon each day. Most of it is absorbed\\n\\nand only 50 to 200 ml is excreted in the faeces. Since the colonic contents move forward very slowly,\\nmost of the nutritionally valuable matter is absorbed.\\n\\nThe large amounts of mucus secretion by the mucosa of large intestine protects the intestinal\\nwalls from the adverse effects of bacterial and other action. The mucus also helps to hold the faeces\\ntogether. The neutralisation of acidic products of bacterial action is ensured by the action of bicarbonate\\nions secreted in exchange for absorbed chloride ions.\\n\\nAbsorption and Transportation\\nAbsorption is the process of sucking up the nutrients in the body. Most of the absorption takes\\n\\nplace in the small intestine. Absorption of food from the digestive tract into the blood and lymph takes\\nplace after the digested food is moved forward by peristaltic waves (muscular contraction and relaxation)\\ninto the small intestine. These peristaltic waves push the food against the absorbing surface of the\\nintestinal wall. The intestinal wall is lined with four to five million tiny finger-like projections called villi\\n(see Figure 2.4.). The cells which cover villi permit the absorption of final products of digestion—\\nsmall molecules of sugars, amino acids and fat products and water, into the vessels that carry away the\\nblood and lymph. The large area of these villi promote efficient absorption of all nutrients. Ordinarily a\\ngreat deal of time is permitted for the absorptive process because the digested material must traverse\\nthe entire length of the intestine a distance of about 20 ft.\\n\\nBesides the shape and size of intestinal wall, other factors affect absorption of the digested food.\\nFor example, bile favours absorption of fats, calcium can be absorbed in the presence of vitamin D and\\nvitamin B12 can be absorbed only in the presence of an intrinsic factor in the gastric juice.\\n\\nThe intestine, which is a semipermeable membrane, is highly selective and permits the passage of\\nnutrients only under certain special conditions. Thus absorption is affected by concentrations of the\\nnutrients in the blood. A high concentration in the blood stream may allow less absorption of vitamins\\nand minerals than would be permitted at a time when the blood level of these nutrients is low.\\n\\nThe sugars, amino acids, water-soluble vitamins, minerals salts and possibly some of the fat\\nproducts are absorbed directly into the blood stream through the intestinal wall and are carried to the\\nliver. The remainder of the end products of fat digestion and the fat soluble vitamins enter into the\\nlymph system.\\n\\n\\n\\nDigestion, Absorption and Utilisation of Nutrients 2121212121\\n\\nIndividuals in normal health may vary in their capacity to absorb even fully hydrolysed foods. The\\nrecommended daily dietary allowances and the daily food guide provide quantities of nutrients generally\\nsufficient to cover the needs of individuals with normal variations in capacities to digest and absorb\\nnutrients.\\n\\nFigure 2.4: Intestinal wall—mucosal folds, villi and microvilli.\\n\\nUtilisation of Nutrients in the Body\\n\\nMetabolism of all nutrients occurs within the cells of our body. The final oxidation of nutrients\\ninto carbon dioxide and water occurs in the mitochondria. About 40 per cent of the energy released is\\nused to synthesise ATP, the remainder is released as heat.\\n\\nThe ATP formed provides energy for the synthetic reactions in the cell. Fatty acid breakdown\\nalso occurs in the mitochondria. The individual cells die and are replaced by new cells formed as part\\nof normal life processes.\\n\\nGlycolysis: Within the tissue cells, the first phase of glucose breakdown occurs in the cytoplasm.\\nThis anaerobic stage of carbohydrate breakdown is known as glycolysis, in which glycogen or glucose\\nis converted to pyruvic acid. This is schematically presented in Figure 2.5.\\n\\nTricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) or Citric Acid Cycle: The intermediate compounds of\\ncarbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism are metabolised by a common final oxidative pathway. This\\npathway is referred to as tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) or Citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle. The name\\ntricarboxylic indicates that it involves acids with three carboxyl (—COOH) groups; it is also called\\nKrebs cycle, as Krebs was the first scientist to have worked it out.\\n\\nIn the mitochondria, pyruvic acid is converted to acetyl coenzyme A CoA before entering the\\ncitric acid cycle.This complex reaction needs five enzymes and four coenzymes, four of which contain\\nfour B vitamins (pantothenic acid, thiamin, niacin and riboflavin). The pantothenic acid is a part of coA\\nstructure. The two carbon acetic acid combines with four carbon oxaloacetic acid forming citric acid\\n(6–C acid), with release of coenzyme A. This is the starting point of the citric acid cycle, which is\\n\\nEnlarged villi, showing\\n“brush border” of microvilli\\n\\nMuscularis mucosae\\n\\nMucosal folds\\n(valvulae\\n\\nconniventes)\\n\\nVilli\\n\\nCircular muscle layer\\n\\nLongitudinal muscle\\n\\nOuter serosa\\n\\n\\n\\n2222222222 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ndepicted in Figure 2.5. In this figure all steps at which hydrogen atoms, carbon dioxide or ATP are\\nformed are shown; a few intermediate substances are omitted.\\n\\nThe cycle moves only clockwise from citric acid to oxaloacetic acid. In each round, one molecule\\nof acetic acid is degraded to carbon dioxide and water with synthesis of ATP. This ATP is the source of\\nenergy for many synthetic reactions in the cells.\\n\\nFigure 2.5: Integration of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. The scheme indicates glycolysis,\\ncitric acid cycle and their interconnections.\\n\\nThe fats are broken down to fatty acids and glycerol. In the cytoplasm, glycerol is transformed\\ninto triose phosphate, which can be oxidised to carbon dioxide and water via TCA cycle or it may be\\nused to form glucose.\\n\\nThe fatty acids are oxidised to form two carbon units in the form of acetyl coA in a stepwise\\nmanner. The acetyl coA enters the citric acid cycle and is metabolised as mentioned above. These\\nreactions occur in the mitochondria.\\n\\n\\n\\nDigestion, Absorption and Utilisation of Nutrients 2323232323\\n\\nBeta-oxidation of fatty acids: The fatty acid oxidation is referred to as beta-oxidation, because\\nfatty acid chain loses two carbon atoms at a time, which means the oxidation starts at the beta carbon.\\nWhen the first two carbons are separated, the new beta-carbon is attacked and so on. This may be\\nrepresented as follows:\\n\\nFigure 2.6: Beta-oxidisation of fatty acids.\\n\\nThe two carbon unit combines with coenzyme A and forms acetyl coA which enters the citric\\nacid cycle. The beta oxidation of fatty acids can be shown as given in Figure 2.6. Acetyl coA may be\\nused to synthesise new fatty acids, cholesterol, etc. As noted before, acetyl coA is formed during\\nbreakdown of both glucose and amino acids. Thus excess energy intake in any form (fats, carbohydrates,\\nproteins) is deposited as fat in the adipose tissue.\\n\\nAmino acids, the products of protein digestion are absorbed by the tissues and used to synthesise\\ntissue proteins, antibodies, some hormones and vitamins.\\n\\nAmino acids are very labile compounds, which can be converted to one another and into other\\nsubstances. The first step in this process is called deamination, the removal of amino group (—NH2).\\nThe amino group may be transferred to a keto-acid to form amino acids, which are normally formed in\\nthe body. Hence these amino acids are not essential to be supplied in the diet.\\n\\nTransamination refers to the transfer of amino groups from one compound to another. Thus L-\\nglutamic acid, loses NH2 to a keto acid, for example pyruvic acid, to form alanine, an amino acid.\\nTransamination reactions are catalysed by transaminases, which need coenzyme containing vitamin B.\\n\\nTransaminases are present in all tissues, but heart, muscle, brain; kidney, liver and testes have\\nhigher concentrations of the enzyme.\\n\\nR\\n\\n(CH )2 3\\n\\nCH2\\n\\nCH2\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nR\\n\\n(CH )2 3\\n\\nC\\n\\nCH2\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nR\\n\\n(CH )2 3\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nCH3\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nR\\n\\nCH2\\n\\nC\\n\\nCH2\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nO O\\n\\nR\\n\\nCH2\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nCH3\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\netc.\\n\\nCH3\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nCOOH\\nCOOH\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\n(CH )2 2 (CH )2 2\\n\\nCH3\\n\\nC\\nC O\\n\\nO\\nCHNH2\\n\\nCHNH2\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\n+ +\\n\\nGlutamic acid Pyruvic acid Alpha-keto glutaric\\nacid\\n\\nAlanine\\n\\n\\n\\n2424242424 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nDeamination occurs when the amino group of an amino acid is oxidatively removed by a special\\ndehydrogenase system to form a keto acid and ammonia. Thus glutamic acid is oxidised to form alpha-\\nketo glutaric acid and ammonia as shown below:\\n\\nThe enzyme required for this deamination reaction is amino acid oxidase, which needs a coenzyme\\ncontaining riboflavin. Liver is the site of most deamination reactions, but if needed, it can occur in the\\nkidneys also. All the deaminated parts of amino acids can enter the citric acid cycle as shown in Figure\\n2.5.\\n\\nMost of the nitrogen containing groups, split off from amino acids (80 to 90 per cent), are\\nconverted to urea in the liver and excreted in the urine.\\n\\nUrea Formation: The ammonia formed in deamination is converted in the liver to urea. Urea is\\nthe main nitrogenous product of amino acid metabolism. On a normal diet, urea forms 85 to 92 per cent\\nof total nitrogen and it is excreted in the urine. Other nitrogenous constituents of urine are uric acid,\\nammonia and creatinine, which form a very small fraction of urinary nitrogen.\\n\\nThe schematic formation of urea is given in Figure 2.7.\\n\\nFigure 2.7: Formation of urea.\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\n(CH )2 2 NH3\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nCHNH2\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\n(CH )2 2\\n\\nCOOH\\n\\nC O\\n+ — O2\\n\\n1\\n2\\n\\nGlutamic acid Alpha-keto glutaric acid Ammonia\\n\\n+\\n\\n\\n\\nDigestion, Absorption and Utilisation of Nutrients 2525252525\\n\\nThe ammonia formed in deamination of amino acids combines with carbon dioxide yielding\\ncompound to form carbamic acid. ATP is required as also Mg++ to form carbamyl phosphate, which\\nreacts with ornithine to form citrulline. The enol form of citrulline reacts with aspartic acid in the\\npresence of ATP to form an intermediate (argino-succinic acid) which gives arginine and fumaric acid.\\nThe arginine is decomposed by arginase to urea and ornithine. The ornithine is ready to take up CO2 and\\nNH3 via carbamyl phosphate again.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. Explain the following: atom, ion, compound, radioisotope, organic acid and synthesis.\\n2.

The results of these studies have been used to work out the nutritional\\nrequirements of Indian people. After adding a factor of safety, the Recommended Dietary Allowances\\n(RDAs) for Indians have been set-up.\\n\\nAn advisory committee of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is responsible for the\\nsetting up; review and revision of these RDAs. Let us understand why and how these RDAs were set-\\nup.\\n\\nWhy were the Recommendations Set-up?\\n\\nIn a number of studies the harmful effects of nutrient deficiencies on the human body and its\\nfunctions were observed. These were so revealing that the League of Nations thought it necessary to\\nset-up a committee to review available experimental data and recommend daily dietary allowances for\\neach of the nutrients that were known at that time.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowances for Nutrients 2727272727\\n\\nDuring the Second World War (1939–45), the military recruiting officers had to reject a number\\nof young men, who wanted to enlist, because they were underweight. Naturally the governments in\\nvarious countries were anxious to rectify this situation. Another related problem was the need to\\nestimate the amount of food to be sent to various army units. This led to the setting up of Recommended\\nDietary Allowances (RDA) in number of countries between, 1940 and 1944. India was one of the first\\ncountries to set-up Recommended Dietary Allowances in 1944. The desirable dietary intakes of energy,\\nprotein, calcium, iron, vitamin A, thiamin, ascorbic acid and vitamin D were suggested in the RDAs\\nset-up in 1944.\\n\\nOn the basis of newer research findings, these recommendations have been revised four times\\nand fifth revision is expected in the near future.\\n\\nIn 1958, the recommendations for energy were revised. In 1968 and again in 1978 allowances of\\nall nutrients except energy were revised. In 1968, additional recommendations were made for four B\\nvitamins, namely riboflavin, nicotinic acid, folic acid and vitamin B12. In 1978, the requirements for a\\none more B vitamin, pyridoxine (B6) were included.\\n\\nIn making these recommendations, the ICMR committee was guided by the dietary allowances\\nsuggested by Expert group of FAO and WHO and also by the results of studies carried out in India on\\nnutrient requirements.\\n\\nIn the 1978 revision, the unit of energy joule, adopted by International Union of Sciences and\\nIUNS (International Union of Nutritional Sciences) has also been included.\\n\\nThe 1978 revision was entitled Recommended Dietary Intake (RDI), to emphasise the intake of\\nnutrients. The word ‘recommended’ is used to emphasise that these values need to be revised periodically\\non the basis of newer research data.\\n\\nThe last revision was made in 1988. The important features of the 1988 revision are:\\n• the revision of body weight standards for Indians\\n• complete revision of energy requirements\\n• definition of quantum and type of fat intakes\\n• modification of RDAs of vitamin A and D\\n• inclusion of several nutrients and dietary factors not considered earlier, such as fibre,\\n\\nelectrolytes (sodium, potassium), magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin E and K, and\\n• for the first time a provisional recommendation on trace elements was made.\\n\\nNo substantial changes were made in the RDAs for protein, B-complex vitamins, iron and calcium.\\n\\nGeneral Principles of Deriving RDA\\n\\nA number of general principles are used to arrive at nutritional requirements of an individual or the\\nRDA for a population. These are:\\n\\n• Dietary intakes: This approach has been used to arrive at the energy needs of children.\\nEnergy intakes of normally growing children is used as the basis for RDA.\\n\\n• Growth: To define requirements in early infancy, the breast milk intake of healthy infants, or\\nthe requirement of any particular nutrient for satisfactory growth has been utilised.\\n\\n• Nutrient balance: As for a number of other nutrients, to arrive at the protein requirements,\\nthe minimum intake of nutrient for equilibrium (intake = output) in adults, and nutrient\\nretention consistent with satisfactory growth in children, have been used widely.\\n\\n\\n\\n2828282828 Fundamentals of Foods and Nutrition\\n\\n• Obligatory loss of nutrients: is the minimal loss of the nutrient or its metabolic product\\nthrough normal routes of elimination (viz., urine, faeces and sweat). It is determined on a\\ndiet devoid of or very low in the nutrient. For example, a protein-free diet in case of proteins.\\nThis information is used to determine the amount of nutrient to be consumed daily through\\nthe diet to replace the obligatory loss. In infants and children, growth requirements are\\nadded to the above maintenance requirements.\\n\\n• Factorial method: In this method, the needs for various functions are assessed separately\\nand added up to assess the total daily requirements. This is the method used to arrive at total\\nenergy requirements.\\n\\n• Nutrient turnover: Data collected by studying turnover of certain nutrients in healthy\\npersons, using isotopically labelled nutrients has been used to determine their requirements.\\nVitamin A, vitamin C, iron and vitamin B12 requirement have been measured in this manner.\\n\\n• Depletion and repletion studies: These have been used to determine the requirements of\\nwater-soluble vitamins. The vitamin status is measured by recording the levels of vitamin or\\nits coenzyme in serum or tissue (e.g., erythrocytes, leucocytes). The requirements of ascorbic\\nacid (vitamin C), thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and pyridoxine have been established using this\\napproach. The subjects are first fed a diet very low in the nutrient being studied until the\\nbiochemical parameters reach a low level. After that feeding graded doses of the nutrient is\\nstudied. The level at which response increases rapidly indicates the level of requirement of\\nthe nutrient.\\n\\nHow is RDA Derived?\\n\\nRDA is derived on the basis of —\\n(a) A knowledge of the requirement of nutrients for each physiological group.\\n(b) It is based on nutrient requirement determined by one or more of the approaches listed\\n\\nabove.\\n(c) The RDA is computed after considering nutrient bioavailability from the diet.\\n(d) It is presumed that the requirement of all other nutrients are met adequately. RDA is applicable\\n\\nonly under this condition.\\n(e) RDA is applicable only to a healthy population living under normal conditions.\\n(f) The RDA is computed after considering individual variability.\\n(g) In practice a level of intake corresponding to the Mean +2 standard deviations, which covers\\n\\nthe requirements of 97.5 per cent of the population is chosen as RDA. This safe level\\napproach is not used in the case of energy, as excess or inadequate intake is undesirable,\\nonly the average requirement of energy is defined as RDA.\\n\\nFor certain nutrients, such as protein, iron, calcium, beta-carotene and vitamin B12, bioavailability\\nfrom the diet is a critical factor.\\n\\nFor proteins, the essential amino acid mix in the diet, which decides the quality of protein is\\nimportant. In the normal Indian diet, protein is derived from several sources, such as cereals, dals and\\nlegumes, milk and milk products and a variety of vegetables. Occasionally fish, eggs and other flesh\\nfoods are included according to one’s taste and resources. Hence the quality tends to be satisfactory,\\ndue to mutual supplementation of individual proteins.\\n\\nIn case of iron, while the total intake may be satisfactory, absorption from foods is a critical\\nfactor. Absorption is affected by the relative presence of both absorption promotors, (acid medium,\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowances for Nutrients 2929292929\\n\\ne.g., ascorbic and other acids) and absorption inhibitors (phytates, tannins, oxalate, etc.). In the diets\\nhabitually consumed in India, which are high in inhibitors and low in promotors, iron absorption is only\\n2 to 5 per cent.\\n\\nIn the case of vitamin A, niacin and others, provitamins present in foods, are converted to the\\nrespective vitamins in the body. The RDA for vitamin A and niacin are defined after considering these\\nfactors.\\n\\nReference Body Weights of Indians\\n\\nThe nutrient needs vary with age and weight of an individual. Body weights and heights of\\nchildren reflect their state of health and growth rate, while adult weight and height represent what can\\nbe attained by an individual with normal growth. Anthropometric measurements of Indian children up\\nto 14 years from well-to-do groups have shown that they grow at rates similar to those of children in\\nthe developed countries. Desirable heights and weights of both children and adults (not the prevailing\\nones) are considered in recommending nutrient intakes as the RDA is intended for a healthy and well-\\nnourished population.\\n\\nIn the 1978 revision of RDA, the body weights of well-to-do Indian children and adolescents\\nwere used to compute their nutritional needs. But for adults, a reference body weight of 55 kg for men\\nand 45 kg for women have been used since 1944. The weights of adults do not match those of well\\nnourished adolescents. Secondly with current heights of 163 cm and 151 cm of Indian adult men and\\nwomen, the corresponding expected body weights would be higher than the reference weights of 55\\nand 45 kg used so far. Hence the ICMR committee recommended that the reference weights for Indian\\nman and woman used for RDA be increased to 60 kg and 50 kg respectively.\\n\\nTable 3.1: Reference Body Weights of Indians of Different Age Groups1\\n\\nWeight\\n(in Kg)\\n\\nMale Female\\n\\nInfants 0–0.5 5.4 5.4\\n0.5–1.0 8.6 8.6\\n\\nChildren 1–3 12.6 11.8\\n4–6 19.2 18.7\\n7–9 27.0 26.7\\n\\n10–12 35.5 37.9\\n\\nAdolescents 13–15 47.9 46.7\\n16–18 57.3 49.9\\n\\nAdults 20–50 60.0 50.0\\n\\n1.

Therefore an individual of given age and size\\nhas been designated as a reference. The reference man and reference woman in the Indian RDA have\\nbeen defined as–\\n\\nReference Woman Age 20–39 years and weight 50 kg\\nReference Man Age 20–39 years and weight 60 kg\\n\\nReference woman is healthy. She may be engaged in 8 hours of moderately active work, in light\\nindustry or in general household work. Apart from 8 hours in bed, she spends 4 to 6 hours in light\\nleisure activities and 2 hours in active household work, recreation or walking.\\n\\nReference man is healthy, free from disease and fit for work. He is employed in moderately\\nactive occupation for 8 hours, spends 8 hours in bed, 4 to 6 hours in leisure activities, sitting and\\nmoving about and 2 hours in active recreation, walking or household duties.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances for Indians\\n\\nThe recommended dietary allowances for nutrients for an adult reference woman and man are\\ngiven in Table 3.2. The table contains RDAs for:\\n\\nEnergy and Protein\\nMinerals—Calcium and Iron\\nWater-Soluble Vitamins—C and six of the B-group\\nFat-Soluble Vitamins—A, E and K\\n\\nBesides these, there are other nutrients, which are required by our body for normal function. It\\nis reassuring to know that on an average, a diet, which provides a sufficient amount of the above\\nnutrients, will meet the need for these other nutrients also. Please remember that a liberal margin of\\nsafety is provided in the recommended dietary intakes to cover differences in needs of healthy persons.\\n\\nAs you can see from Table 3.2, only two nutrients are needed in large amounts—energy and\\nproteins. The RDA for energy is about 40 kcal per kg for a sedentary man and 37 kcal per kg body\\nweight for a sedentary woman. Moderately active man’s RDA is 48 kcal per kg and woman’s 40 kcal\\nper kg body weight. The RDA of a man engaged in heavy activity is 63 kcal and a woman 58 kcal per\\nkg body weight. Thus knowing your body weight and the type of work you do, you can estimate your\\nenergy needs.\\n\\nThe RDA for protein is based on 1 g per kg body weight. It does not vary with activity.\\nThe RDA for minerals is much less, calcium is 400 mg per day for both man and woman, while\\n\\niron is only 28 to 30 milligrammes per day. As you know, a milligramme is one thousandth part of a\\ngramme. An adult woman needs more iron than a man, to make up for the periodic loss of iron in\\nmenstruation.\\n\\nThe five water-soluble vitamins, namely thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine and ascorbic acid,\\nare needed in very small amounts and their RDAs are expressed in milligrammes. The remaining two B-\\nvitamins, folic acid and vitamin B12 are needed in very minute amounts and hence their RDA are\\nexpressed in microgrammes (mcg). A microgramme is one-millionth part of a gramme. The amount of\\nB-Vitamins needed is related to the total energy needs and therefore varies with the RDA for energy.

Our physical activity is normally dependent on our occupation or profession. The variation\\nin energy needs with age, physiological status and occupation is illustrated in Figure 3.1.\\n\\nUse of Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs)\\n\\nThe recommended dietary allowances for nutrients have a number of practical uses. These are :\\n1. To enable government to predict food needs of the population.\\n2. To provide basis for food distribution quota.\\n3. To guide agricultural planning policy.\\n4. To guide policy of food export and import.\\n5. To guide planning of nutritionally adequate diets for inmates of large catering establishments\\n\\nsuch as hospitals, hostels, hotels, army canteens, etc.\\n6. To evaluate the findings of food consumption surveys of population groups.\\n\\nFigure 3.1: Energy and protein needs vary with age and occupation.\\n\\nIn practical nutrition classes, the recommended dietary allowances are often used for planning or\\nchecking the adequacy of food intake of individuals, or of a given diet plan. You have to be cautious in\\nthe use of recommended allowances of nutrients in this manner, because you must consider the body\\nsize of the individual, which may differ from that of the reference person.\\n\\nSecondly a diet that provides the recommended amounts of nutrients may be adequate; a diet\\nwhich does not meet these may not be a poor one since there is a liberal margin of safety provided in\\nthe RDAs.

Can you imagine a\\nmeal without rice, chapati or some other cereal preparation? No. Rice, wheat and other grains are an\\nimportant part of each of our meal everyday. Thus cereals are our staple food. In the Indian dietary,\\nabout 65 to 80 per cent energy is provided by carbohydrates.\\n\\nThere are practical reasons for the universal use of carbohydrates in diets. The yield of cereals,\\nthe primary source of carbohydrates, is high per unit area. Therefore, they are widely available and are\\nan economic source of energy. They are easily packed and have a long shelf-life in dry storage. They\\nare mild flavoured and combine well with other foods. Carbohydrate foods are easy to prepare.\\n\\nLet us consider the nature, composition, properties, functions, food sources, utilisation,\\nrequirement, and effect of deficiency of carbohydrates.\\n\\n\\n\\n3838383838 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nNature, Composition and Classification\\n\\nCarbohydrates are synthesised by all green plants using solar energy, water from the soil and\\ncarbon dioxide from the air. This complex process is called photosynthesis, the prefix photo indicates\\nthe importance of sunlight in this process. Plants are thus the primary source of food in the world.\\n\\nCarbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The suffix hydrate indicates that water and\\noxygen occur in the same proportion as in water.\\n\\nThe members of the simplest class of carbohydrates have a single unit—monosaccharide (mono\\nor one, saccharide or sugar containing). Glucose is an example of this class. The disaccharides contain\\ntwo sugars linked together to form a chain. Cane or beet sugar (sucrose), milk sugar (lactose), and\\nmaltose (malt sugar) are members of this class. Carbohydrates made up, of long chains of sugars are\\ncalled polysaccharides (poly—many). Among them are starch, dextrins, glycogen, cellulose,\\nhemicelluloses, pectins, plant gums and mucilages. Table 4.1 presents the types and sources of\\ncarbohydrates occurring in nature.\\n\\nTable 4.1: Forms and Sources of Carbohydrates\\n\\nCarbohydrates Main Food Sources Remarks\\n\\nPolysaccharides\\n\\nCellulose and hemicelluloses Stalks and leaves of vegetables Indigestible\\nOuter covering of seeds Indigestible\\n\\nPectins Fruits Indigestible\\nGums and mucilages Plant secretions & seed exudates Indigestible\\nStarch and dextrins Grains, legumes & tubers Digestible\\nGlycogen Meats and scafood Digestible\\n\\nDisaccharides\\n\\nSucrose Cane and beet sugar, mollasses Digestible\\nLactose Milk and milk products Digestible\\nMaltose Malt products, some breakfast cereals Digestible\\n\\nMonosaccharides\\n\\nGlucose Fruits, honey, corn syrup Digestible\\nFructose Fruits, honey Digestible\\nGalactose Milk Digestible\\n\\nSimple carbohydrates include mono- and disaccharides. These are small molecules, which dissolve\\nin water and are absorbed very quickly in the body. In contrast, starches and dietary fibres are very\\nlarge, complex molecules, containing several hundred small sugar units and are absorbed slowly.\\nTherefore polysaccharides are referred to as complex carbohydrates. Individual members of each of\\nthese classes (starch, pectins, gums, mucilages, cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin) differ in the type of\\nsmall units they contain and in the way these units are united in the molecule.\\n\\nGlucose, the most common monosaccharide, is present in honey, fruits and corn syrup. After\\nabsorption of food it is transported through blood and hence is present in blood as an easily available\\nsource of energy.\\n\\n\\n\\nCarbohydrates 3939393939\\n\\nSucrose is the ordinary sugar available in the grocery store and used in beverages and food\\npreparations as a sweetener. As you can note from the table, it is mainly manufactured from cane sugar\\nin the tropics and sugar beets in the temperate regions. It is also present in molasses, honey, fruits and\\nvegetables. Sucrose is hydrolysed to a mixture of equal amounts of glucose and fructose by action on\\ndigestive enzymes or when boiled with acid (such as citric acid from fruits). This mixture of glucose\\nand fructose is called invert sugar and it is used in preparation of candies and icings.\\n\\nMaltose does not occur in free form in nature. It is formed during sprouting of grains or in\\ndigestion of starch by action of enzymes. It contains two glucose molecules. Lactose is the sugar in\\nmilk. It yields glucose and galactose on hydrolysis by lactase. It is less soluble than sucrose and\\nmaltose and less sweet than glucose. Persons, who have lactase insufficiency, cannot utilise lactose\\nand hence have to restrict their intake of milk and milk products. Children, who are born without the\\nliver enzyme lactase, cannot digest milk and have to be fed soya milk instead.\\n\\nStarch is found in cereal grains, legumes and in tubers. Glycogen is found in meats and seafood.\\nThese are digestible polysaccharides.\\n\\nCellulose and hemicelluloses, pectins, gums and mucilages are indigestible polysaccharides.\\nCelluloses are found in stalks and leaves of vegetables and outer coverings of seeds. Pectins are present\\nin fruits and gums and mucilages are part of plant exudates and seeds.\\n\\nProperties\\n\\nSugars are soluble in water, are sweet to taste and are hygroscopic (absorb water from the\\natmosphere). As they are hygroscopic, they need to be stored in air tight containers. Sugars vary in\\ntheir solubility in water; sucrose is more soluble than glucose. Carbohydrates, can be ranked according\\nto their sweetness. Fructose is the sweetest and the most soluble sugar. It is followed by sucrose,\\nglucose, dextrin and lactose. The relative sweetness of sugars is indicated in Table 4.2.\\n\\nTable 4.2: Comparative Sweetness of Sugars\\n\\nSugar Sweetness Value\\n\\nFructose 173\\n\\nInvert sugar 130\\n\\nSucrose 100\\n\\nGlucose 74\\n\\nGalactose 32\\n\\nMaltose 32\\n\\nLactose 16\\n\\nStarches are not sweet, but bland in flavour. Tender corn is sweet, as it matures it becomes less\\nsweet as sugars are converted to starch. Raw fruits contain starch, which changes to sugars during\\nthe ripening process with development of sweet taste.\\n\\n\\n\\n4040404040 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFunctions\\n\\nCarbohydrates have many important functions in the body:\\n1. The primary function of carbohydrates in the body is to supply energy. Each gramme of\\n\\ncarbohydrate, as starch or sugar, provides 4 kcal/g. Carbohydrates are a source of readily\\navailable energy, which is needed for physical activities as also the work of the body cells.\\nThe brain and the central nervous system are dependent on the constant supply of glucose\\nfrom the blood to meet their energy needs.\\n\\n2. Carbohydrates act also as reserve fuel supply in the form of glycogen, stored in muscles\\nand liver. The total amount of glycogen in the body is over 300g. But it must be maintained\\nby regular intake of carbohydrates at frequent intervals, so that the breakdown of fat and\\nprotein tissue is prevented.\\n\\n3. Carbohydrates serve other special functions in the body. Carbohydrates provide chemical\\nframework, which combine with the nitrogen to synthesise non-essential amino acids in the\\nbody.\\n\\n4. Carbohydrates and their derivatives work as precursors of important metabolic compounds.\\nThese include nucleic acids, the matrix of connective tissue and galactosides of nerve tissue.\\n\\n5. Lactose, the milk sugar, provides galactose needed for brain development. It aids absorption\\nof calcium and phosphorus, thus helping bone growth and maintenance.\\n\\n6. Lactose forms lactic acid in the intestinal track due to the action of the bacteria (lactobacilli)\\npresent there. These lactobacilli synthesise some of the B-complex vitamins. It aids, bacteria\\n(lactobacilli) present to suppress the activities of putrefactive bacteria and protects us from\\ntheir undesirable effects.\\n\\n7. Carbohydrates are an important part of some compounds, which increase our resistance to\\ninfection (immunopolysaccharides). Ribose, a five carbon sugar, is an essential part of DNA\\nand RNA. Carbohydrates are a part of important compounds, which are components of\\nnervous tissue (galactolipid), heart valve, cartilage, bone and skin (chondroitin sulfate).\\n\\n8. Carbohydrates are needed for ensuring complete normal metabolism of fats, thus preventing\\nacidosis.\\n\\n9. Carbohydrates are needed to prevent dehydration. A low carbohydrate diet causes loss of\\nwater from tissues as also electrolytes (especially sodium and potassium) in the urine and\\ncan lead to involuntary dehydration.\\n\\n10. Dietary fibre acts like a sponge and absorbs water. It helps smooth movement of food waste\\nthrough the digestive tract and the soft, bulky stools are comfortably eliminated.\\n\\nFood Sources\\n\\nCarbohydrates are synthesised by plants and occur in several forms. Starch is found in plant\\nseeds (cereals and legumes), roots and tubers. These foods are the primary energy sources in the\\nhuman dietary (Table 4.3).\\n\\nThe intake of complex carbohydrate in the form of cereals, dals and legumes, in normal Indian\\ndietary is sufficient. Cereals, which are the staple food in the Indian dietary, contribute major part of the\\nenergy and proteins, and some minerals and vitamins. Dals and legumes provide significant amounts of\\nproteins, iron and B-vitamins, in addition to energy. Potatoes, yams, jackfruit are good source of starch\\n\\n\\n\\nCarbohydrates 4141414141\\n\\nCalories/unitFood\\n\\nin the diet. Vegetables and fruits provide dietary fibre, minerals and vitamins. Milk is the only animal\\nfood, which is the source of a very important sugar—lactose—in the diet.\\n\\nSugars are found in fruits; the percentage is about three in melons, ten in citrus fruits and guava\\nand seventeen in mango. Thus fruits are an excellent snack food as they are a dilute source of quick\\nenergy and other nutrients.\\n\\nSugars found in plant sap or juice (sugarcane and beetroot) is extracted to give pure 100 per cent\\nsugar. It must be used judiciously, as it provides only energy. The intake of foods high in added sugars,\\nsuch as soft drinks, syrups and sweets needs to be controlled to avoid obesity.\\n\\nTabe 4.3:  Carbohydrate Content of Foods\\n\\nCarbohydrate\\n\\ng/100g g/unit\\n\\nRice, rice flakes, rawa, 75–78 19 86–88\\nvermicelli, etc.\\n\\nWheat flour (atta), jowar 69–72 17–18 82–87\\n\\nDals, 58–60 15 84–87\\n\\nTapioca or cassava 38 19 80\\n\\nBanana* 27 22 95\\n\\npotato, colocasia, chiku, peas, 16–22 8–11 40–49\\nyam, jackfruit\\n\\nMango 17 9 37\\n\\nOrange, guava, pear, apple, 7–13 3–6 24–30\\ncarrot, onion, clusterbeans\\n\\nLeafy and other vegetables 1–4 1–2 6–17\\n\\nMilk 5 7 100\\n\\nSugar 100 5 20\\n\\n* One banana has about 80g edible portion\\n\\nUtilisation in the Body\\n\\nStarch is partly hydrolysed by ptyalin (salivary amylase) in the mouth to dextrose and maltose.\\nStarch and dextrin are further hydrolysed to maltose by amylase in the small intestine. Maltose, sucrose\\nand lactose are further broken down to glucose, fructose and galactose (simple sugar units) by the\\nenzymes maltase, sucrase and lactase.\\n\\nThe glucose formed by the digestion of the starch and sugar is absorbed mainly into the blood\\nthrough the walls of the intestine and carried to the liver. The glucose thus absorbed helps to maintain\\nthe glucose level in blood and the glycogen stores in the muscle and the liver. Whenever we need\\nenergy, the glycogen is broken down to glucose which is oxidised and the energy produced is used by\\nthe body. Any excess glycogen is converted to fat.\\n\\n\\n\\n4242424242 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nRegulation of Blood Sugar\\n\\nLiver glycogen is continually converted to glucose and diffuses into the blood to replace the blood\\nglucose used up by the tissues. Muscle glycogen is used for energy by the muscles. Only when muscle\\nglycogen is oxidised to lactic acid, the lactic acid is carried to liver and converted to glucose and\\nglycogen.\\n\\nIn normal persons, the blood sugar level is maintained at a constant level, which is 70 to 100 mg\\nper 100 ml, under fasting conditions. A number of hormones regulate the reactions, and ensure the\\nmaintenance of normal blood sugar level. These hormones are insulin, glucagon, epinephrine,\\nglucocorticoids, thyroxine and growth hormones.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowance\\n\\nA minimum of 100g carbohydrates are needed in the diet to ensure the efficient oxidation of fats.\\nMost diets supply more than this amount. If the carbohydrate foods are consumed in excess of the\\nbody’s    need, the excess is converted into fat and is stored as reserve. No daily allowance has been\\nfixed for carbohydrates. As it is the cheapest source of food energy, it supplies up to 80 per cent of the\\ncalories in the low cost diets in India. If the proteins supply about 10 per cent of the calories, fat 20 per\\ncent, then carbohydrates must supply the remaining 70 per cent calories.\\n\\nClinical Problems\\n\\nObesity:  It is very easy to take sweets, mithais, candy, soft drinks, etc., in excess of one’s\\nneeds. Most of these sweets contain a lot of fat also, which is a concentrated source of calories. When\\nthe energy intake exceeds expenditure, the excess is deposited as fat. Over a period of time, overweight\\nand obesity can occur. Obesity is known to be a predisposing factor for a number of health problems.\\n\\nDental caries: If sugar remains in contact with the teeth, it tends to lead to tooth decay. If it is\\nnot checked, it may lead to dental caries. Chewy sweets tend to remain in contact with teeth for long\\nperiods, unless children are taught to rinse their mouth thoroughly after eating candy, as also food.\\n\\nDeficiency\\n\\nIf less than required amount of carbohydrates is consumed the body first burns its own fat and\\nthen its tissue proteins for heat and energy. To prevent this, daily diet must supply the required amount\\nof carbohydrates regularly.\\n\\nDietary Fibre\\n\\nCellulose, hemicellulose and pectins which are components of the skins of fruits, coverings of\\nseeds and the structural parts of edible plants are usually referred to as ‘Fibre’. Cellulose is not soluble\\nin hot or cold water. pectins which occur in ripe fruits have the ability to absorb water and to from gels.\\nThis property of pectins is made use of in the preparation of jams and jellies.\\n\\nThe structural parts of plants, which are not digested by enzymes in the human intestinal tract are\\nknown as dietary fibres.\\n\\nClassification and Sources: Dietary fibre includes:\\n(i) Structural parts of plant cell walls (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), which are not soluble\\n\\n\\n\\nCarbohydrates 4343434343\\n\\nin water, are classed as insoluble fibre. Water insoluble fibres are found in whole wheat,\\nwheat bran, seeds, nuts and vegetables.\\n\\n(ii) Viscous plant fibres are soluble in water. These include pectins, gums and mucilages. Soluble\\nfibres are found in fruits, oat and barley, legumes and beans.\\n\\nFunctions: The human body does not have enzymes capable of breaking down cellulose,\\nhemicellulose and pectins and so fibre is not digested in the body. However, in view of their ability to\\nabsorb water, these indigestible substances serve a useful purpose in helping with the elimination of\\nintestinal wastes. They stimulate the peristalitic (rhythmic) movements of the gastrointestinal tract by\\nadding bulk to the intestinal contents.\\n\\nThe insoluble fibre needs chewing and may improve mastication of food. Dietary fibre absorbs\\nwater, swells and thus increases surface area of the mass. Thus there is increased contact between the\\nfood mass and enzymes and hence digestion improves. There is also a feeling of fullness. The spongelike\\nswollen mass of fibre ensures smooth elimination of faeces.\\n\\nFibre reduces transit time and binds some minerals such as calcium, iron, zinc, etc. Soluble fibre\\nbinds bile acids and cholesterol and helps carry these out of the body. There is no recommended dietary\\nallowance for fibre. However, nutrition researchers and dieticians suggest that fibre intake be increased\\nto 25 grammes or more per day.\\n\\n50 g.

Unusual sources include agar-agar obtained from sea weed (Table 4.4).\\n\\n\\n\\n4444444444 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nUtilisation in the Body: As has already been described, these groups of substances are not\\ndigestible and do not contribute any nutrients to the body. These indigestible substance, however, do\\nserve a useful purpose in facilitating the elimination of intestinal wastes. They stimulate the peristaltic\\nmovements of the gastrointestinal tract.\\n\\nRequirements: The exact amount of fibre needed by the human body cannot be stated. Some\\nexperts feel 100 mg fibre per kg or about five to sixs grams per day is sufficient for the adult. An\\naverage mixed diet consisting of a raw vegetable, fresh fruit with skins, cooked fruits and vegetables\\nwill usually provide sufficient fibre. Fibre content of the diet can be increased by use of some whole\\ngrain cereals or whole wheat bread. Chapatis made from whole wheat flour are also a good source of\\nfibre.\\n\\nTable 4.4: Fibre Content of Foods\\n\\nFood Fibre g/100g EP1\\n\\nCereals, whole 1.2–1.9\\n\\nCereals, refined 02–0.7\\n\\nPulses, whole 3.7–5.3\\n\\nPulses, split 0.7–1.5\\n\\nNuts and oilseeds 1.3–6.6\\n\\nVegetables\\n\\nLeafy and other 0.5–3.2\\n\\nRoots and tubers 0.4–1.8\\n\\nFruits 0.5–2.7\\n\\n 1. EP-Edible portion.\\n\\nEffect of Deficiency: Lack of fibre in the diet usually makes it difficult to eliminate food waste\\nfrom the body. Consistent shortage of fibre in the diet could lead to constipation and other disturbances\\nof the colon. This condition could be corrected by including foods containing whole grain cereals,\\nfruits with skins and vegetable and fruit salads in the diet.\\n\\nRole in Health and Disease: Constipation is a common problem in large percentage of the\\npopulation. One of the reasons for this condition is the intake of refined foods. An increase in fibre\\nintake helps to correct this ailment. Eating leafy vegetables, cluster beans, etc., has been found to\\nensure smooth, regular elimination.\\n\\nWith regular elimination of softer stools, the formation of haemorrhoids is reduced and\\ndiverticulosis is prevented or controlled. Pectins and gums bind bile acids and cholesterol and thus\\nreduce their blood levels.\\n\\nDietary fibre by increasing  bulk and needing more chewing may reduce the food intake. Thus it\\ncan help obese persons to reduce total energy intake and lose weight.\\n\\nThe carbohydrate absorption is slowed, which helps to regulate blood sugar and lowers insulin\\nneed of diabetics.\\n\\n\\n\\nCarbohydrates 4545454545\\n\\nLarge soft stools may dilute potential carcinogens. Rapid transit of stools may reduce content of\\ncarcinogens in colon mucosa and thus reduce risk of colon cancer.\\n\\nSome problems due to high fibre diets: Dietary fibre is best taken from natural foods and not\\nas fibre supplements. Food sources provide a variety of fibres, vitamins and minerals in combination,\\nwhereas fibre supplements do not supply any nutrients. An excessive intake of fibre may result in\\nintestinal obstruction, if it is not accompanied by a liberal intake of water. If fibre intake is increased\\nsuddenly, complaints such as cramping, diarrhoea and excessive intestinal gas are common. To minimise\\nthese effects, the fibre content of the diet should be gradually increased over a period of several weeks.\\n\\nSugar Substitutes\\n\\nCommercial sugar substitutes or artificial sweeteners are used by people, who wish to reduce\\ntheir calorie intake. Two of the commonly available sugar substitutes are aspartame and saccharin.\\n\\nAspartame is a dipeptide of two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine. Its trade names\\nare Equal and Nutrasweet. As the dipeptides are unstable to heat, this sweetener cannot be used in\\ncooked or baked foods. Persons, who suffer from phenylketonuria should avoid use of aspartame.\\n\\nSaccharin is o-sulphobenzimide. It is 300 to 500 times as sweet as sucrose and passes through\\nthe body unchanged. It has been used as a sugar substitute for about hundred years without any\\nadverse effects. It is used in beverages and desserts. The only drawback is it leaves a bitter aftertaste,\\nif used in large amount.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. Why are cereals used as staple food in India?\\n2. What is photosynthesis?\\n3.

The cells and\\ntissues of our body have fat as an integral part. The vital organs (brain, heart, liver) are protected by a\\n\\n\\n\\nFats and Other Lipids 4747474747\\n\\nsheath of fat and water, which holds them in place and prevents injury. The nerves are also protected\\nby fat. A layer of fat beneath the skin acts as a insulation against cold. The fat around the joints acts as\\na lubricant and allows us to move these smoothly. Thus fat is a crucial part of the body composition.\\n\\nFats are the best known members of a chemical group called, the lipids. They constitute an\\nimportant part of our Indian dietary and supply 10–30 per cent of the total energy needs. Food fats\\ninclude solid fats, liquid oils and related compounds such as fat-soluble vitamins and cholesterol.\\n\\nIn the middle of last century, fats were expensive and a meal containing large amounts of fat was\\ncalled a ‘rich meal’. Persons consuming such meals were thought to be healthy. But with the improvement\\nin the methods of production and their availability, there has been an indiscriminate increase in fat intake\\nin some sections of society leading to overweight and obesity. The weight increase discourages\\nmovement, increases pressure on the circulation, respiration and skeletal frame. Hence it is recognised\\nas a risk factor for several chronic ailments.\\n\\nIn this chapter, let us consider fats not only as essential body component, nutrient and compact\\nstorage fuel, but also as a health hazard. We need to achieve a realistic balance between meeting our\\nneeds and avoid health problems due to excessive intake.\\n\\nComposition\\n\\nLipids is an overall group, which includes all fats and related compounds. The word is derived\\nfrom the Greek word lipos which means fat. It is used in combination words to name fat-related health\\nproblems, e.g., hyperlipidemia refers to elevated level of blood fats.\\n\\nLike carbohydrates, lipids contain the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, and some contain\\nphosphorus and nitrogen. Lipids have fewer oxygen atoms in their structure than carbohydrates.\\nTherefore more oxygen is needed to oxidise lipids and more energy (about 2.25 times) is released per\\ng of lipid as compared to a g of carbohydrate.\\n\\nLipids are an essential part of the body structure. Body fat accounts for 15 to 20 per cent of body\\nweight in healthy non-obese men and 18 to 25 per cent in healthy non-obese women. The fat content\\nof body increases in sedentary individuals and senior citizens if they do not have active leisure time\\nactivities.\\n\\nLipids are widely distributed in nature. They are soluble in organic solvents, namely, ether,\\nchloroform, benzene and other fat solvents. Fatty acids, fats and oils, phospholipids, sterols and\\nlipoproteins are some of the groups of lipid compounds, which are important in the study of nutrition.\\n\\nSources\\n\\nVegetable oils, used in food preparation, are extracts of oilseeds and nuts. The important sources\\nof vegetable oils are depicted in Figure 5.1. Butter and ghee are animal fats extracted from milk.\\n\\nPlant oils are hydrogenated to form a almost solid fat known as vanaspati. Vanaspati is usually\\nfortified with vitamin A and D, as it is used in place of ghee. The sources of fats in our dietary are listed\\nin Table 5.1. Oils, butter, ghee and vanaspati contribute the visible fats in the Indian dietary. The\\namount of oils and fats in the diet vary with the region. As these are expensive foods, the amount and\\nkind used in the dietary, varies with the socio-economic status of the family.\\n\\nThe animal foods, milk, egg, meat and liver, which contain fat, are sources of hidden fat in  the\\ndiet. Nuts, oilseeds, milk, eggs and meat supply not only fat but also protein , minerals and vitamins of\\nthe B-complex group. Ghee, butter, eggs and liver are good sources of vitamin A. Some refined oils and\\n\\n\\n\\n4848484848 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nvanaspati are fortified with vitamin A. Use of ghee, butter, fortified refined oil or vanaspati helps to\\nmeet a part of the day’s need for vitamin A.\\n\\nTable 5.1: Names, Formulae and Melting Points of Some Common Fatty Acids\\n\\nNo. of Carbon Fatty Acids Formulae Melting Point\\nAtoms in °C\\n\\nSaturated\\n4 Butyric C3H7COOH –7.9\\n6 Caproic C5H11COOH –3.4\\n10 Capric C9H19COOH 31.6\\n16 Palmitic C15H31COOH 62.9\\n18 Stearic C17H35COOH 69.6\\n\\nUnsaturated\\n\\n18 Oleic CH3(CH2)7CH = CH(CH2)7COOH 16.3\\n18 Linoleic CH3(CH2)4CH = CHCH2CH = CH(CH2)7COOH – 5.0\\n18 Linolenic CH3CH2CH = CHCH2CH = CHCH2CH = – 11.0\\n\\nCH(CH2)7COOH\\n\\n20 Arachidonic CH3(CH2)4(CH = CHCH2)4(CH2)2COOH – 49.5\\n\\nFigure 5.1: Important sources of vegetable oils.\\n\\nPalm oil\\n\\nPericarp\\nShell\\n\\nKernel\\n\\nPalm kernel oil\\n\\nPericarp\\n\\nShell\\nMilk\\n\\nCopra\\nKernel\\n\\nOliveOliveOliveOliveOlive SoyaSoyaSoyaSoyaSoya\\n\\nCoconutCoconutCoconutCoconutCoconutOil palmOil palmOil palmOil palmOil palm\\n\\nSunflowerSunflowerSunflowerSunflowerSunflower Cot tonCot tonCot tonCot tonCot ton GroundnutGroundnutGroundnutGroundnutGroundnut\\n\\n\\n\\nFats and Other Lipids 4949494949\\n\\nVegetable oils contain poly-unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic, linolenic and arachidonic-\\nacid. Linoleic and arachidonic acid are required for growth and maintenance of integrity of the skin.\\nTable 5.2 indicates the poly-unsaturated fatty acids present in various oils and fats. It may be noted that\\nvegetable oils are a fairly good source of essential fatty acids.\\n\\nIt is easier to control visible fats in the diet than that which is hidden. For example, one can\\nmonitor use of butter, ghee and oil used directly. Invisible fats include the cream in the milk and dahi,\\nnuts used in preparation and as such, egg yolk, oil used in seasoning vegetables, dal and salads. Even\\ntoned milk contains 3 per cent fat. Invisible fat contributes about 10 or more per cent of total energy in\\nthe diet.\\n\\nClassification\\n\\nLipids are classified into three groups on the basis of their chemical structure:\\n1. Simple lipids, which include fats and oils,\\n2. Compound lipids, which comprise of phospholipids and lipoproteins, and\\n3. Derived lipids such as fatty acids and sterols.\\n\\nTable 5.2: Sources of Fats\\n\\nFood g/100g Calories/100g\\n\\nVisible Fats\\nOil, vegetables 100.0 900\\nVanaspati 100.0 900\\nGhee, cow’s 99.5 895\\nButter 81.0 729\\n\\nInvisible Fats\\nOilseeds & nuts 37.0–64.5 537–681\\nMutton, muscle 13.3 194\\nEggs, hen 13.3 173\\nLiver, sheep 7.5 150\\n\\nMilk, cow 4.1 67\\n\\nFats, Oils and other Lipids\\nThere is no precise definition of the word ‘fat’. The term is applied to foods which are fatty,\\n\\nimmiscible in water and greasy in texture.\\nEvery fat molecule has glycerol at its core and three fatty acids attached to it. The nature of the\\n\\nfat or the oil depends on the kind of fatty acids linked to the glycerol. The hardness, melting-point and\\nthe flavour of the fat is related to the length of the carbon chain and the level of the saturation of the\\nfatty acid. If the substance is a liquid at 20°C it is called an oil, if solid at that temperature, it is known\\nas fat.\\n\\nSaturated fatty acids are found in solid fats whereas most of the oils contain unsaturated fatty\\nacids.\\n\\n\\n\\n5050505050 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThe unsaturated fatty acids can be converted to saturated ones, thus changing the physical and\\nchemical characteristics of the oil, by a process known as hydrogenation in which hydrogen is added\\non to the oils, in the presence of a catalyst. In the commercial process, hydrogen is added to some (not\\nall) of the double bonds of the unsaturated fatty acids to increase the firmness and the melting point of\\nthe product. However, this processing also changes the isomers (shape, configuration) of some of the\\nremaining unsaturated fatty acids. Most unsaturated bonds in nature are in a ‘cis’ form (folded pattern),\\nbut after hydrogenation, many double bonds are in a linear pattern, a ‘trans’ form. Thus although they\\nare still unsaturated, these ‘trans’ fatty acids behave like saturated fatty acids.\\n\\nTable 5.3: Linoleic and Linolenic Acid Content of Edible Oils\\n\\nS.No. Oil Linoleic Linolenic Total EFA\\ng/100g g/100g g/100g\\n\\n1.

Fatty acids have a methyl group (CH3) at one end\\nand a carboxyl group (COOH) at the other end with a chain of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the\\nmiddle (formula at the end of the chapter).\\n\\nAbout twenty fatty acids are found in foods and body tissues. The fatty acids have three important\\naspects, chain  length, saturation and essential fatty acids.\\n\\nThe number of carbon atoms in fatty acid decides the chain length. Thus short chain fatty acids\\ncontain 4 to 6 carbon atoms, medium chain 8 to 12 carbon atoms, long chain fatty acids have 14–18\\ncarbon atoms and extra-long-chain fatty acids have more than 20 carbon atoms in the molecule. Milk,\\nfat, vinegar and coconut contain short chain fatty acids, long chain fatty acids are found in most\\nvegetable oils and animal fats. Fish oils contain the extra-long chain fatty acids (Table 5.4).\\n\\n\\n\\nFats and Other Lipids 5151515151\\n\\nSaturated fatty acid has a single bond  between its carbon atoms, thus the molecule is saturated\\nwith hydrogen. Stearic acid is an example of a saturated fatty acid.\\n\\nUnsaturated fatty acids have one or more double bonds in their molecule and are thus not\\nsaturated with hydrogen.\\n\\nFurther monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) have only one double bond in the molecules.\\nOleic acid, found in olive oil, is a monounsaturated fatty acid.\\n\\nTable 5.4: Some Fatty Acids in Foods\\n\\nName No. of C atoms Chain Length Type Food Source\\n\\nAcetic 2 Short Saturated Vinegar\\n\\nButyric 4 Short Saturated Butter\\n\\nCaproic 6 Short Saturated Butter\\n\\nCaprylic 8 Short Saturated Coconut\\n\\nMyristic 14 Long Saturated Nutmeg and Mace\\n\\nPalmitic 16 Long Saturated Palm oil and lard\\n\\nStearic 18 Long Saturated Beef tallow\\n\\nOleic 18 Long Monounsatd. Olive oil\\n\\nLinoleic 18 Long Polyunsatd. Groundnut, sesame,\\ncorn oil, sunflower\\n\\nClupanadonic 22 Extra-long Polyunsatd. Fish oils\\n\\nPolyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have two or more double bonds in the molecules. Corn oil\\ncontains polyunsaturated fatty acids.\\n\\nThe methyl end of the fatty acid molecule is called the omega end. If the first double bond in the\\nfatty acid is in the third carbon atom from the methyl end, it is called omega-3 fatty acid; if it is in the\\nsixth carbon from the methyl end, it is called omega-6- fatty acid and when it is in the ninth carbon, it\\nis called omega-9 fatty acid.\\n\\nExamples of these are:\\nOleic acid — Omega-9-fatty acid, which is a MUFA\\nLinoleic acid, omega-6-fatty acid, which is a PUFA.\\nLinolenic acid, omega-3-fatty acid, which is also a PUFA.\\nFatty acids are found in all simple and compound lipids. Palmitic (16 carbons), stearic (18 C),\\n\\noleic (18 C) and linoleic (18 C) are some of the common fatty acids.\\nA small part of free fatty acids are bound to the protein albumin of the blood and are transferred\\n\\nfrom the adipose cells to the liver, muscles and other sites.\\n\\nTriglycerides\\n\\nFatty acids combine with glycerol to form a glyceride. When only one fatty acid combines with\\nglycerol, it forms a monoglyceride. Diglycerides have two fatty acids and triglycerides three fatty\\n\\n\\n\\n5252525252 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nacids attached to glycerol. Most of the fatty acids in the body as also in foods occur in the form of\\ntriglycerides.\\n\\nTriglyceride molecules contain glycerol — a three carbon alcohol, as a backbone. Three fatty\\nacids are attached to the three hydroxyl groups (–OH) of glycerol and three molecules of water are\\nreleased in this formation of a triglyceride.\\n\\nThe fatty acids which combine with glycerol may vary in the length of the chain (–R) and vary in\\ndegrees and type of saturation.\\n\\nEvery time a triglyceride crosses a cell membrane, it must be broken or deesterified and after it\\nenters the cell it is reesterified. In digestion, most triglycerides are hydrolysed to form free fatty acids,\\nmonoglycerides and glycerol, which are absorbed into the intestinal cells and the majority of these are\\nrebuilt into triglycerides.\\n\\nPhospholipids, which are present in every cell, are formed mainly in the liver from fatty acids,\\nglycerol, phosphoric acid and a nitrogenous base. Phospholipids look like triglycerides, but contain a\\nphosphate attached to glycerol in place of one fatty acid. For example, lecithin, a phospholipid contains\\ncholine-phosphate attached to one hydroxyl of the glycerol molecule (formula at the end of the chapter).\\n\\nLecithin is an important component of all membranes. It takes part in fat digestion. Egg yolk\\ncontains lecithin in abundance. Two other phospholipids – sphingomyelins and cerebrosides – are\\nfound in the brain. It is not necessary to provide phospholipids in the diet, as our body makes these\\nwhen and where it needs.\\n\\nPhospholipids are important as components of active tissues (brain, nervous tissue and liver).\\nThey are powerful emulsifying agents and are essential for the digestion and absorption of fats.\\nPhospholipids help to carry lipid particles across the cell membrane in the blood stream.\\n\\nSterols are lipids with a multiringed (steroid) structure. Three sterols with functions associated\\nwith nutrition are:\\n\\nErgosterol a plant sterol\\n7-dehydrocholesterol an animal sterol and\\ncholesterol an animal sterol\\nErgosterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol are two precursors of vitamin D.\\nCholesterol is an important sterol. It is a waxy substance. As you can  see (in the formula at the\\n\\nend of the chapter), cholesterol contains a hydroxyl group (–OH), but it does not resemble a triglyceride.\\nLike all other lipids, it dissolves in organic solvents (ether, chloroform, etc.). It is the best known of the\\nsterols and has attracted attention because of the association of elevated blood cholesterol levels with\\nheart ailments.\\n\\nTriglycerides, phospholipids and sterols share a common background — most parts of these\\nmolecules are synthesised from a derivative of acetic acid, which is the smallest fatty acid.\\n\\nCholesterol is an essential part of each cell and every type of human cell makes cholesterol.\\nEach day our liver makes about 800 mg of cholesterol, which circulates through the blood stream and\\nis used wherever it is needed.\\n\\nIt is a precursor of vitamin D, hormones and bile acids. The hormones made from cholesterol\\ninclude corticosteroids, estrogens, testosterone and calcitriol (the active vit. D hormone). Bile acids\\nneeded for fat digestion, are formed from cholesterol.\\n\\nThe cholesterol content of heart, liver, kidney and egg (embryonic stage of life) is quite high. In\\ninfancy and toddlers stage, new tissues are formed, especially brain which need cholesterol. Hence fat\\nshould not be restricted in the diet of children up to five years of age.\\n\\n\\n\\nFats and Other Lipids 5353535353\\n\\nLipoproteins are synthesised in the liver. They are composed of three-fourth to two-third lipids\\nand the remainder protein. These serve as the major vehicle for fat transport in the blood stream. The\\nblood is mainly water and fat needs a water soluble cover of protein to permit it to be carried by blood.\\nThe lipoproteins contain triglycerides, cholesterol and other substances such as fat soluble vitamins.\\nThe density of lipoproteins is dependent on the amounts of fat and protein in it. The higher the fat\\ncontent, the lower the density.\\n\\nFour groups of, lipoproteins that have been identified are chylomicrons, low density lipoproteins\\n(LDL), high density lipoproteins (HDL), and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). The LDLs carry\\nfat and cholesterol to cells. The HDLs carry free cholesterol from body tissues to the liver for breakdown\\nand excretion. Like cholesterol, there is much interest now in these lipoproteins because their concentration\\nin the blood plasma needs to be maintained within certain limits for good health. Their levels in blood\\nplasma are routinely tested to detect lipid disorders, which are related to heart ailments.\\n\\nFunctions\\n\\nFat is a major nutrient and it has several functions. Oils and fats are concentrated sources of\\nenergy. Each, gramme supplies 9 calories.\\n\\nBesides providing energy, oils and fats have several functions in the body. Food fats are a source\\nof two groups of essential nutrients — essential fatty acids (EFA) and fat soluble vitamins A, D, E & K\\nand their precursors. Food fats also aid the transport and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.\\n\\nCholesterol is an essential lipid synthesised in the liver. Some important hormones and bile acids\\nare formed from cholesterol. Fat forms the fatty centre of cell walls, helping to carry nutrient materials\\nacross cell membranes.\\n\\nFats are used to synthesise phospholipids, which are found in all cells.\\nFat stored in various parts of the body is known as adipose tissue. The vital organs in the body\\n\\nare supported and protected by a web-like padding of this tissue. Fats act as a cushion for certain vital\\norgans. Nerve fibres are protected by the fat covering and it aids relay of nerve impulses.\\n\\nSince fat is a poor conductor of heat, a layer of fat beneath the skin helps to conserve body heat\\nand regulate body temperature.\\n\\nThe flavour, palatibility and satiety value of foods is increased by fats. The slower rate of digestion\\nof fat as compared to carbohydrates results in a feeling of satisfaction.\\n\\nFats may have other functions, which are not as yet clear.\\n\\nEssential Fatty Acids (EFAs)\\nLinoleic acid (omega-6 PUFA) and linolenic acid (omega-3 PUFA) are called essential fatty acids\\n\\nbecause\\n1. these are not synthesised in the human body\\n2. these are required for important functions in the body and\\n3. these are available only through diet.\\n\\nThe EFAs have several important functions. They are essential for growth in the young and\\nmaintenance of normal healthy skin. Their other functions are as components of membranes to ensure\\ntheir permeability to water and other small molecules. They are precursors of eicosanoids, a group of\\nimportant metabolites which regulate vascular function, one of these are prostaglandins.\\n\\nThe omega-3 fatty acids, DHA (decosa hexenoic acid) and EPA (eicosa pentenoic acid) have an\\nimportant role in fetal brain and eye development. These acids also protect against rheumatoid arthritis\\nand cardiovascular diseases.\\n\\n\\n\\n5454545454 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nCertain varieties of fish are the richest food sources of these fatty acids. In some countries\\n‘designer eggs’ have been produced with enhanced levels of these omega-3 fatty acids by including\\nDHA-rich algae in the chicken feed.\\n\\nCommon plant oils with the exception of coconut are good sources of linoleic acid.\\nGreen leafy vegetables, cabbage and lettuce are good sources of omega-3-fatty acids. Soyabean\\n\\nand rape seed are also good sources of omega-3-fatty acids. Fatty fish, such as tuna, sardines and\\nsalmon are good sources of omega-3-fatty acids and a weekly consumption of any of these fish can\\nhelp to meet the need.\\n\\nThe U.K. Dept. of Health Publication (1991) recommends that linoleic acid (n-6) should provide\\nat least one per cent and linolenic acid (n-3) at least 0.2 per cent dietary energy for infants, children and\\nadults to meet their EFA requirements (Table 5.2).\\n\\nEFAs are used to synthesise certain prostaglandins. Prostaglandins prolong bleeding time, reduce\\nthe thickness and stickiness of platelets, lower levels of triglycerides and very low density lipoproteins\\n(VLDL) in the blood. Thus artery blockage is reduced. Prostaglandins also reduce inflammation and\\nthus reduce pain in certain ailments (e.g., in rheumatoid arthritis).\\n\\nDeficiency of EFAs: Deficiency of EFAs results in a flaky skin, development of itchy sores on\\nscalp and retardation of growth. Diarrhoea and other symptoms may also develop. These symptoms of\\ndeficiency appear in low-birth weight infants fed fat-free formulas and in adults fed for long periods on\\nintravenous solutions, which contain no lipid.\\n\\nEFA deficiency results in changes in the fatty acid composition of many tissues, which include\\nbiological membranes and mitochondria.\\n\\nDigestion and Absorption\\n\\nThe digestion of fats starts in the stomach, where a coarse emulsion forms due to churning\\naction. The chemical changes necessary for fat digestion occur in the small intestine. The entry of fat\\nin the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine stimulates secretion of the bile from the gall\\nbladder. The fat gets emulsified by the bile preparing it for digestion.\\n\\nThe fat is broken into small particles, thus increasing the surface area and the surface tension is\\nlowered improving the enzyme action and penetration. Pancreatic lipase breaks off one fatty acid at a\\ntime from the triglyceride. Thus one fatty acid plus a diglyceride, then another fatty acid plus a\\nmonoglyceride and glycerol are produced. Each subsequent step of this process occurs with more\\ndifficulty.\\n\\nThe cholesterol esterase from pancreatic juice acts on the free cholesterol to form a combination\\nof cholesterol and fatty acids for absorption first into the lymph vessels and finally into the blood\\nstream.\\n\\nLecithinase, secreted by the small intestine, acts on lecithin to break into its components for\\nabsorption.\\n\\nThe products of digestion are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine and circulated\\nthrough the lymph. Some of these are used to synthesise important lipid compounds needed for body\\nfunction. Some fat is used to supply energy. The rest is stored as fat in the adipose tissues for future\\nuse.\\n\\n\\n\\nFats and Other Lipids 5555555555\\n\\nFat Intake in India\\n\\nDiet surveys by National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau (NNMB) of India show that the daily intake\\nof visible fats vary from 3 to 20g/day in rural India and 20 to 42g/day in urban areas. In addition\\ninvisible fat intake may vary from 16 to 30 g and in some population groups 50g/day. Thus the total fat\\nintake may contribute 10 to 30 per cent of dietary energy.\\n\\nThe nature of edible oil used in the diet varies from one part of the country to another; it is\\ngroundnut oil in west and south India, coconut oil in Kerala, rape/mustard oil from punjab to West\\nBengal along the Gangetic plain and safflower in north Karnataka and parts of southern Maharashtra.\\n\\nWhile a minimum amount of fat in the diet is essential, excess is harmful. Hence the minimum\\nlevel and the safe upper limit of fat intake have to be considered.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances\\n\\nThe fat requirement is based on two factors, namely to meet energy and the essential fatty acids\\nneeds. About 10 per cent of the total energy need is met by invisible fat in the diet. A minimum of 5 per\\ncent of total energy needs to be provided as visible fat in the diet. This works out to about, 12 g of fat\\nper day. A higher, level of intake of 20 g/day is desirable to provide energy density and palatability for\\nnormal adults.\\n\\nIt is desirable that an upper limit of 20 g/day of fat intake for adults and 25 g/day for young\\nchildren be followed, in view of the possible complications resulting from excessive intake of fat.\\nHowever, in order to meet the essential fatty acid needs, the diet should contain at least 10 g of\\nvegetable oil, which is a good source of linoleic acid.\\n\\nDiet and Heart Ailments\\n\\nFat is essential for our health, but too much of it can lead to ill health. A section of Indians have\\na high intake of fat, a large part of it is saturated fats (milk sweets, eggs and other flesh foods), and a\\nvery sedentary lifestyle. Their energy intake in excess of needs leads to obesity and an unacceptable\\nblood lipid profile. If unchecked, there is deposition of fatty material with formation of plaques in the\\narteries, which disturbs the movement of oxygen and nutrients. It leads to a variety of heart ailments,\\nsuch as atherosclerosis, high blood pressure and others.\\n\\nThere are a number of factors associated with susceptibility to heart ailments that can be controlled\\nto a great extent. These include elevation of plasma lipid levels, obesity, physical inactivity and heavy\\nsmoking.\\n\\nThe risk factors related to diet will be discussed here.\\n\\nEffect of Diet on Plasma Lipids\\n\\nPlasma cholesterol (CHOL): Research conducted at Stanford and other medical centres throughout\\nthe world has proved that few heart attacks occur in people, who have total CHOL readings in the\\n160mg/dl range. The risk of heart disease accelerates as the total CHOL level creeps past the 200 mg/\\ndl mark.\\n\\nAnimal fats, a source of saturated fats in the diet, are also high in CHOL content. The saturated\\nfats are known to increase the total CHOL and LDL production in the liver, leading to increased levels\\nin the blood plasma.\\n\\n\\n\\n5656565656 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIncreased serum CHOL level above 200 mg/dl and low density lipoproteins (LDL) above 130 mg/\\ndl are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). The high-density lipoproteins\\n(HDL) level in the blood is a beneficial factor, as it protects the blood vessel against formation of fatty\\ndeposit (atheroma), by moving the fatty material away.\\n\\nThe following changes in lifestyle can help normalise the plasma CHOL and LDL level:\\n• Reduce in intake of saturated fats (ghee, butter, vanaspati, lard, etc.).\\n• Reduce food cholesterol intake to 300 mg/day or less.\\n• Increase physical activity to alter cholesterol components in the blood plasma.\\n• Attain and maintain ideal body weight for your body build and height by controlling your\\n\\ntotal energy intake.\\nPlasma triglycerides (TRG): Triglycerides, another blood fat, have been identified as the\\n\\ntransporter that moves fat in the bloodstream from one location to another. For instance, it moves it to\\nyour liver when it needs it, to your muscles when you are exercising or to your waistline when you are\\nnot.\\n\\nHigh triglyceride levels are linked to coronary heart disease (CHD), though the connection is still\\nnot well understood. When a high LDL and high TRGs (levels over 200 mg/dl) were found together;\\nthe risk for subsequent heart attacks, increased. It appears that refined sugar causes TRGs to rise; one\\nof the reasons for controlling excessive sugar intake in a heart-healthy diet.\\n\\nThe level of fat in the diet has been the subject of many studies. In one study, healthy, normal-\\nweight volunteers were placed on either an ultralean 10 per cent fat diet or a rich 40 per cent fat diet.\\nEach volunteer ate the number of calories required to maintain his/her body weight. Each ten days their\\nTRG level in plasma was checked. They found that the volunteers on high-fat diet were manufacturing\\nlittle or no fat. But those on low-fat diet were producing copious amounts of saturated fat. Sensing that\\na fat famine was under way, their bodies had cranked up the machinery that converts carbohydrates\\ninto fat, one of the built-in mechanisms that permits humans to survive in lean times. In fact, 30 to 57\\nper cent of the fatty acids in their TRGs was self-made saturated fat. Thus moderate intake of fats may\\nbe desirable to maintain normal TRG levels.\\n\\nResearch findings suggest that meal patterns may influence the blood lipid levels. In a college\\nstudy, it was found that the mean CHOL and TRG values were the lowest in those eating six meals a\\nday and highest in those eating one meal a day. Thus frequent, regular meal times, with appropriate,\\nmoderate mix of fat and carbohydrate components, and appropriate calorie restriction, can help to\\ndecrease plasma TRGs level and maintain it at normal level.\\n\\nPhysical Activity: Besides diet, physical activity is an important component in the control of\\nobesity, plasma lipid levels and prevention of CHD. Exercise lowers fasting plasma TRG levels even\\nduring periods of increased energy intake. It is also known to increase the level of HDL, which protects\\nthe health of the blood vessels.\\n\\nThus it is possible for us to prevent disabling heart disease and ensure the health of our heart.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

It accounts for about a sixth\\nof the live body weight and a third of it is found in the muscles, a fifth in the bones and cartilage, a tenth\\nin the skin and the remainder in other tissues and body fluids.\\n\\nThere are thousands of different specific proteins in the body, each having a unique structure and\\nfunction. For this reason, the word protein implies not one but a large group of complex compounds.\\n\\nProteins are present in all living tissues, both plant and animal. They are essential to life because\\nvital parts of the nucleus and protoplasts of every cell are proteins.\\n\\nComposition\\n\\nProteins are very large organic compounds. Proteins, like carbohydrates and fats, contain carbon,\\nhydrogen and oxygen. In addition, proteins contain about 16 per cent nitrogen, which is their unique\\nfeature and distinguishes them from carbohydrates and fats. Some proteins also contain sulphur and\\nsometimes phosphorus, iron and cobalt. Proteins are more complex than fats and carbohydrates, as the\\nsize of the molecule is large and there is a great variation in the units from which it is formed.\\n\\nPlants are the primary source of proteins in nature. Proteins are synthesised by the plants from\\nthe nitrates and ammonia in the soil. Herbivorous animals use plant proteins to meet their protein needs.\\nMan uses plant foods as also animal foods (milk and meat) to meet his protein needs. Nitrogen is\\nreturned to the soil through degradation of products of animal metabolism, excretion of nitrogen\\ncompounds in urine and faeces, and decomposition of animal body at death, to complete the natural\\nnitrogen cycle.\\n\\nStructure and Classification\\n\\nAll proteins in our body and food are built from basic units or compounds known as amino acids.\\nAmino acids combine to form proteins by means of a peptide bond, which joins a carboxylic carbon of\\none amino acid with nitrogen of another.1 The resulting peptide has a free carboxyl at one end and a free\\namino group at the other, permitting addition of other amino acids at either end. The proteins are amphoteric\\nin nature due to the presence of a free acid and a free amino group in their molecule. Polypeptiddes thus\\nformed constitute the primary structure of proteins. The secondary structure formed by linking\\nseveral polypeptide chains may be helical, pleated or random coil. More complex proteins have a tertiary\\nstructure in whcih the polypeptide chain is wound into a globular form.\\n\\nProteins exist in fibrous or globular form. Fibrous proteins appear in structure elements, e.g.,\\ncollagen of connective tissue, myosin of muscle tissue and keration of hair. Globular proteins are very\\nsoluble and occur in tissue fluids; these include casein, egg albumin, albumins and globulins of blood\\nplasma and haemoglobin. In conjugated form, they form most of the intracellular enzymes.\\n\\n1.The word ‘amino’ indicates that they contain a — NH2 group; the word ‘acid’ indicates that they contain a\\n\\n—COOH (an acid or carbonyl group). The common structure of an amino acid is\\n\\n‘R’ indicates the remainder of the molecule. This attachment may be a hydrogen atom or a more complex\\ngroup; its structure accounts for the difference in various amino acids.1\\n\\nHOOC — C — R ,  where,\\n\\nNH2\\n|\\n\\n|\\nH\\n\\n\\n\\n6060606060 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nSimple proteins yield only amino acids on hydrolysis. Albumins, globulins, glutelins, prolamins\\nand albuminoids are simple proteins. Albumins and globulins, which are soluble in water and salt\\nsolution are present in animal fluids (milk, blood, plasma). Those which are less soluble are present in\\ntissues (muscle, protein, myosin).\\n\\nConjugated proteins are combinations of simple proteins with non-protein substances. The\\ncombinations result in formations, which are functionally very important to the body. Conjugated\\nproteins include:\\n\\n• Lipoproteins (proteins + lipids) found in blood plasma (HDL, LDL, VLDL, etc.).\\n• Nucleoproteins (proteins + nucleic acids) found in cells (RDA, DNA).\\n• Mucoproteins and glycoproteins (proteins + polysaccharides) found in gastric secretion\\n\\n(mucin).\\n• Phosphoproteins (proteins + phosphoric acid) are found in milk, e.g., casein.\\n• Metalloproteins (proteins + metals) are found in ferritin, hemosidirin.\\n\\nDerived proteins are proteoses, peptones and peptides formed in the various stages of protein\\nmetabolism.\\n\\nFunctions\\n\\nThe primary function of proteins is tissue building.\\nProteins are the main solid matter in the muscles, they are also the major constituents of blood,\\n\\nmatrix of  bones, teeth, skin, nails and hair. Our body, which consists of about 60 per cent water and\\n19 per cent fat is held together by only 17 per cent proteins and 4 per cent minerals.\\n\\nThe principal functions of proteins in the body are discussed below.\\nBody-Building or Building of New Tissues: Protein is an essential part of every cell. We cannot\\n\\nsynthesise (form) protein from simple nitrogen compounds as plants do. Therefore amino acids must\\nbe supplied in the diet for building new tissues. Proteins provide the amino acids needed for the formation\\nof new cells. They also provide the material from which nucleic acids are formed, e.g., DNA and RNA,\\nwhich carry the genetic code.\\n\\nThe amount needed at various stages of life varies with the rate of growth. Infants need more\\nproteins per unit of body weight than adolescents, because the rate of growth is the highest during\\ninfancy. More protein is needed in the last part of pregnancy as compared to the first part.\\n\\nThere may be a need to supply extra protein, to rebuild tissues after their loss or destruction. The\\nloss may occur in any one of the following ways;\\n\\n1. Donation of blood,\\n2. Excessive menstruation,\\n3. Haemorrhage after an accident,\\n4. destruction of tissues due to burns, in wasting diseases such as TB (tuberculosis0, rheumatic\\n\\nfever, etc.\\nMaintenance of tissues: The need for protein to maintain and repair the old tissues continues\\n\\nthroughout life. Proteins in the body tissues are not static; they are constantly being broken down and\\nreplaced by new protein synthesised from amino acids from dietary and tissue sources. For example,\\nthe lining of the intestinal tract is renewed almost everyday and a half; the protein in the liver and blood\\nplasma is broken down and remade every six days, blood cells have a life span of 120 days and\\nadequate replacement must be supplied to avoid anaemia. In fact, all body proteins are constantly being\\n\\n\\n\\nProteins and Amino Acids 6161616161\\n\\ndegraded and synthesised at varying rates. Thus there is a continuous need for protein to provide for\\nthe maintenance of tissues already built.\\n\\nRegulatory Functions: Haemoglobin, a protein and iron complex, ensures the smooth running\\nof respiratory cycle by being the vital oxygen carrier in the red blood cells.\\n\\nProteins in fluids such as blood help to regulate body processes. Plasma proteins contribute to\\nosmotic pressure and thus exert an important influence on the exchange of water between tissue cells\\nand the surrounding fluids and on the water balance of the body as a whole.\\n\\nThe amphoteric1 nature of proteins is useful in maintaining acid-base  balance of blood and\\ntissues. Their amphoteric nature further makes them ideal carriers of nutrients across cell membranes.\\nThe blood proteins (haemoglobin and oxyhaemoglobin) combine with the carbon dioxide formed in\\ncellular metabolism and excrete it in the expired air. The metabolic products which are acidic or basic\\ncombine with protein and are carried through the system without affecting the tissue pH excessively.\\n\\nProteins as Precursors of Enzymes, Hormones and Antibodies: A small amount of protein\\n(or of amino acids) is needed for synthesising enzymes, hormones and antibodies. All enzymes are\\nproteins and are essential catalysts in digestion and metabolic processes in the tissues. Hormones,\\nsecreted by various glands are proteins in nature. Hormones regulate and co-ordinate body processes\\nand activities. Hormones are chemical messengers, synthesised in the body. They are responsible for\\nregulating all the activities of the body. Examples of hormones are insulin, thyroxine, growth hormones,\\nsteroid hormones, etc. Proteins form antibodies and special white blood cells defend the body against\\ninfection and disease and thus participate in the body’s immune system.\\n\\nTransport of Nutrients:  Due to their amphoteric nature, proteins are ideal carriers of nutrients\\nacross cell membranes. Proteins as lipoproteins transport triglycerides, cholesterol, phospholipids and\\nfat soluble vitamins across the cell wall. Specific protein carriers ensure transport of many vitamins\\nand minerals. Albumin carries free fatty acids, bilirubin as also many drugs.\\n\\nSpecial Functions of Amino Acids: Almost all amino acids have some unique functions in the\\nbody. A few of these are listed here. Tryptophan serves as a precursor for the B-vitamin niacin and\\nserotonin, a neuro-transmitter. Glycine, a simple ubiquitous amino acid is used in synthesis of porphyrin\\nnucleus of haemoglobin. It is also a constituent of one of the bile acids. It combines with many toxic\\nsubstances to form harmless products, which are excreted.\\n\\nGlycine, methionine and arginine synthesise creatinine, which with phosphate forms creatine\\nphosphate, an important, form of high energy compound in the cell.\\n\\nHistidine is used in the synthesis of histamine used as a vasodilator in the circulatory system.\\nGlutamic acid is a precursor of a neuro-transmitter. Phenylalanine is a precursor of tyrosine and\\ntogether they lead to the formation of thyroxine and epinephrine. Tyrosine is also the precursor of skin\\nand hair pigment. Methionine, the sulphur-containing amino acid, is the principal donor of methyl\\ngroups in the synthesis of choline and other important compounds.\\n\\nMilk Formation : Mother’s milk is the first food for a young of any mammal. Human milk\\ncontains about 1.2 per cent protein. The milk proteins are synthesised in the mammary gland from the\\navailable dietary and tissue proteins. A nursing mother needs to take extra protein in her diet to meet the\\ndemands of protein for milk formation.\\n\\nEnergy Supply: A small part of the body’s need for energy (about 6 to 12 per cent) is supplied by\\nproducts of protein metabolism. Each gramme of food protein yields four calories to the body.\\n\\n1. Amphoteric: capable of acting both as a base and an acid.\\n\\n\\n\\n6262626262 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n1. Amount of food per unit is indicated in, Chapter 14, Table 14.1.\\n2. Units as recommended in the food guide in Chapter 14.\\n3. Units of animal foods included in the diet, vary with dietary pattern and cost.\\n\\ng in units recommended2Food\\n\\nFood Sources of Protein\\n\\nPlants are the primary source of protein, because they can synthesise protein by combining\\nnitrogen and water from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air. Animals depend on plants to fulfill\\ntheir protein requirement.\\n\\nThe food sources of protein are listed in Table 6.1. It may be observed that pulses, whole and\\nsplit, nuts and oilseeds, milk, eggs, fish, poultry and meat are good sources of protein the diet. Cereals\\nand their products are a major source of protein in the Indian dietary (Figure 6.1).\\n\\nCereals and pulses, when cooked in water, supply only one-third or less of the protein present in\\nthe raw foods, as these foods absorb at least two times their weight of water. There is no increase in\\nweight of milk, eggs, meat and fish during cooking. Therefore, there is likely to be very little decrease\\nin the amount of protein supplied by these foods when cooked.\\n\\nAnother aspect of evaluating the foods as sources of protein is the quantity of food that is\\nnormally consumed and the frequency of the use of the food. In India, cereals are consumed in large\\nquantities and are included in almost all the meals. Therefore, these contribute a large part of the day’s\\nneed for protein in the Indian dietary. Secondly, pulses are included in most of the meals, along with the\\ncereals, which results in a high quality protein in the diet. Proteins from leafy vegetables are an excellent\\nsupplement to the cereal diet.\\n\\nMilk is one animal food, which is accepted and included in menus for feast as well as fast. The\\nquantity of milk included depends on the availability and cost. Thus cereals, pulses, milk and milk\\nproducts contribute most of the protein in the Indian dietary.\\n\\nDry, salted or smoked fish and meat are inexpensive concentrated sources of protein. These\\ncontribute valuable protein in the diet of people from coastal regions.\\n\\nTable 6.1: Sources of Protein\\n\\nUnits recommended\\nfor adults g per unit1\\n\\nCereals—rice, wheat, 10 2–3 20–30\\n millets and their products\\n\\nDals, pulses 2 6 10–12\\nMilk, Curds, etc.3 1–2 5 5–10\\nEggs3 1 6 6\\nMeat, Fish, Poultry3 0–1 5–6 5–6\\nVegetables\\n\\n   Leafy green 1 1–2 1–2\\n     Beans and Peas 1 2–4 2–4\\n\\n  Roots, Tubers and Others 1 1 1\\n\\nFruits (vitamin C-rich) 1 1 1\\n\\nProtein\\n\\n\\n\\nProteins and Amino Acids 6363636363\\n\\nEggs are included in one meal of the day by those who accept them. Normally fish, meat and/or\\npoultry are included one or two times a week. Please remember that the importance of any food as a\\nsource of protein depends on how often and how much of it is consumed.\\n\\nIt may be observed that the concentration of protein in most vegetables and fruits is small.\\nTherefore, these may not be counted to supply more than  10 per cent of the day’s intake. Though the\\nquantity supplied may be small, these proteins do enhance the quality of protein in the diet.\\n\\nIt is known that if the kinds and amounts of amino acids in the food proteins in a meal are in\\nkeeping with the body’s need, the protein mix is efficiently utilised. Thus when cereals and pulses are\\nincluded in the same meal, the essential amino acid content of the two together is more in keeping with\\nthe body’s needs than that of each of these taken singly.\\n\\nAny additional foods such as curd (buttermilk) and vegetables or fish/meat, which may be included\\nin the meal may help improve the quality of the protein by virtue of the essential amino acids they\\nsupply. Thus including two or more sources of protein in the menu for each meal helps to improve the\\nquality of protein and its utilisation. Some of the regional dietary patterns are based on this principle.\\n\\nFigure 6.1: Food Sources of Protein.\\n\\n\\n\\n6464646464 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nProtein Digestion and Absorption\\n\\nProtein digestion starts only in the stomach as there are no protein splitting enzymes in the saliva.\\nIn the stomach, protein is hydrolysed by the enzymes with the help of hydrochloric acid into peptides\\nor amino acids. This process continues in both the duodenum and the small intestine, where the\\npancreatic and intestinal enzymes complete the hydrolysis by converting almost all the protein into\\namino acids.\\n\\nFigure 6.2: Protein-energy malnutrition.\\n\\nIt is reported that approximately 92 per cent of the dietary protein is digested from a mixed diet.\\nProteins of plant origin, especially those bound with cellulose are digested less then those of animal\\norigin. The amino acids thus formed are absorbed either by the stomach wall, the intestinal walls or by\\nthe colon. Most of the amino acids are, however, absorbed in the small intestine. After passing through\\nthe walls of the digestive tract, the amino acids are picked up by the circulating blood stream and\\ntransported to the liver and to the various body tissues.\\n\\nFor the synthesis of proteins in the body, both essential and non-essential amino acids must be\\navailable in adequate amounts.\\n\\nNon-essential amino acids can be formed in the body by the combination of essential amino acid\\ngroups with metabolic products of carbohydrates and fats by a process known as transamination.\\n\\nSome of the amino acids are split off by a process known as deamination. The nitrogenous by-\\nproducts, if not utilised, are excreted in urine as urea, uric acid and creatinine.\\n\\nEssential Amino Acids\\nThere are 22 (or more) amino acids, all of which are vital to human life and health. The body is\\n\\n\\n\\nProteins and Amino Acids 6565656565\\n\\nable to synthesise 13 of these but is unable to make 9 others. These nine amino acids have to be\\nprovided in the diet in sufficient amounts and are called essential amino acids.3\\n\\nArginine is called semiessential, because it may not be synthesised in sufficient amounts to meet\\nthe rapid growth of infants, especially premature ones and may need to be supplied in the diet.\\n\\nNon-essential amino acids: The word non-essential is misleading for these are necessary in the\\nbody for tissue building, repair and other metabolic functions. These are so important that the body\\nsynthesises these itself. The only reason these are termed non-essential is because these need not be\\nprovided in the diet. The formulae of amino acids are given at the end of the chapter.\\n\\nProtein Quality\\n\\nThe food proteins vary greatly in their amino acid compositon. Protein quality depends on the\\nkinds and amounts of the essential amino acids present in the food proteins. It is reported that certain\\nfood proteins lack one or more essential amino acids. For example, cereals are low in lysine, most of\\nthe pulses contain a small amount of methionine. Most of the animal proteins such as milk, eggs,\\npoultry, fish and meat contain all essential amino acids.\\n\\nHowever, as cereals and pulses are normally consumed together with other foods such as vegetables,\\ncurd, etc., the lack in one food is supplemented by the other foods. In other words, various foods\\nwhen eaten together in a meal, complement each other and improve the quality of protein supplied to\\nthe body.\\n\\nMeasurement of Protein Quality\\n\\nThere are several methods to determine the quality of protein in the diet. These are biological\\nvalue (BV), net protein utilisation (NPU), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and chemical score.\\n\\nBiological Value:  Biological value is the percentage of the absorbed nitrogen (N) retained by the\\nbody. The nitrogen content of the food eaten by an animal and the nitrogen content of the urine and\\nfaeces are determined. The biological value (BV) is calculated by using the formula:\\n\\n) faecal-(dietary  absorbed \\n100) faecal (urinary - (dietary body  by the retained BV\\n\\nNNN\\nNNNN ×+=\\n\\nThe quality of protein is directly related to its BV. The BV increases with increase in the percentage\\nof nitrogen absorbed being retained.\\n\\nThe  BV of milk is 84, brown rice 73 and whole wheat 65.\\nDue to complementary effect of food mixtures, the BV of mixed diets is higher than the arithmetical\\n\\naverage of the component of food proteins.\\nNet Protein Utilisation (NPU): Net protein utilisation is digestibility of protein multiplied by its\\n\\nBV.\\nProtein Efficiency Ratio (PER): Protein efficiency ratio is not based on intake and output of\\n\\nfood protein residues. Therefore it is less accurate than  BV and NPU. But the technique is easy and it\\nis also easy to use. In this method, a known amount of test protein in an adequate diet is fed to young\\nrats for four weeks under standardised conditions and the weight gain is determined. The PER is\\nobtained by dividing the weight gain by grams of protein fed.\\n\\n3. Eight amino acids needed by adults are isoleucine (I), leucine (L), lysine (L), methionine (M), phenylalanine\\n(P), threonine (T), tryptophan (T) and valine (V). One needed by growing chindren is histidine (H).\\n\\n\\n\\n6666666666 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nPER = gin  fedprotein \\ngin gain weight \\n\\nThe PER of milk is reported to be 3 and polished rice 2.2.\\nChemical Score: Chemical score is based on the comparison of amino acid composition of the\\n\\nfood protein with the amino acid of a reference protein scuh as milk, egg or FAO reference protein\\n(1973). The amino acid score is the concentration of the limiting amino acid per gram in the food/food\\nmixture as a percentage of the same amino acids per gram in the acid of the reference protein.\\n\\nThe formula used is:\\n\\nprotein reference of g / acid amino same  theof mg\\n100 protein  test of g / acid amino limiting of mg ×\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowance\\nThe requirement of the body for protein as determined by nitrogen balance studies is between 0.5\\n\\nto 0.6g/kg of body weight in adults, when the source of protein supplies the amino acids in the proportion\\nneeded by the body. In practice, the amino acids of the food combination may not be so well proportioned;\\ntherefore the recommended daily allowance for protein is set to 1.0 g/kg of body weight for adults.\\n\\nDuring infancy, pregnancy and lactation there is an increased need of protein for growth. Persons\\nsuffering from burns or wasting diseases such as tuberculosis and rheumatic fever, also need additional\\nprotein for regeneration of wasted tissues. Similarly if there is loss of blood due to excessive menstruation,\\nhaemorrhages or blood donation, more protein is needed in the diet.\\n\\nThe recommended dietary intake of proteins are presented in Table 6.2.\\n\\nTable 6.2:  Recommended Dietary Intakes of Proteins.1\\n\\nParticulars of the Individual Protein g/day\\n\\nMan (60 kg) 60\\nWoman (50 kg) 50\\nWoman, pregnant (latter half of pregnancy) 65\\nWoman, nursing mother (0–6 months of lactation) 75\\nInfants, 0–6 months 2.05 g/kg/day\\nInfants, 7–12 months 1.65 g/kg/day\\nChildren, 1–3 years 22\\nChildren, 4–6 years 30\\nChildren, 7–9 years 41\\nBoys 10–12 years 54\\nGirls 10–12 years 57\\nGirls 13–15 years 70\\nBoys, 13–15 years 65\\nBoys, 16–18 years 78\\n\\nGirls, 16–18 years 63\\n\\n1. Recommended Dietary Intakes for Indians, ICMR, 1990.\\n\\n\\n\\nProteins and Amino Acids 6767676767\\n\\nVegetarian Diets\\n\\nA large number of Indian people (10 to 15 per cent of the population) are vegetarians, due to their\\nreligion and belief in the principles of non-violence. A large section of non-vegetarians (about 80 per\\ncent) restrict their consumption of animal foods to one or two days of the week. Thus they are\\nvegetarians for 5 to 6 days each week. One important feature of the Indian diet is that milk and milk\\nproducts are accepted universally in the vegetarian diet. Thus they are lactovegetarians. It is easy to\\nplan a nutritionally adequate lactovegetarian diet. Indian vegetarians, therefore, do not face the problems\\nencountered by vegans and fruitarian in meeting their nutritional needs.\\n\\nProtein Sources in the Indian Vegetarian Diet: The protein sources in the Indian vegetarian\\ndiet are cereals, dals and legumes, milk and milk products, immature beans and peas, vegetables and\\nfruits. Over six varieties of cereals and millets and sixteen types of dals and legumes are used in Indian\\ndiet. Being a tropical country there are over 150 varieties of leafy and 250 other vegetables to choose\\nfrom, resulting in nutritionally rich combinations.\\n\\nIn the normal Indian diet, cereals are the staple food and dals or legume, milk and vegetable\\npreparations are served with cereal preparations. Naturally the quality of the protein combination is\\nexcellent.\\n\\nClinical Problems\\n\\nProtein Excess: Though protein is a vital need of the body, intake of excess creates stress on the\\nbody function. The liver has to deaminise the extra amino acids and synthesise urea. The loss of\\ncalcium in the urine is increased with high protein intake. High protein from animal foods carries\\nundesirable saturated fats also along with it.\\n\\nAs protein foods are expensive, their increased intake may lead to lesser intake of nutrient rich,\\nfoods and thus reduce the quality of the diet. Adequate protein is good; but excess intake is not\\ndesirable.\\n\\nDeficiency of Proteins\\nLatent stage: The deficiency of proteins accompanied by that of energy is one of the most\\n\\ncommon nutritional deficiencies in India. In the early stages, it may not be noticed. Research reports\\nindicate that animals on low protein  diets tend to be small, but their functioning is not affected.\\nChildren tend to have retarded growth but this may not be noticed, if all children from the neighbourhood\\nare of small stature due to protein deficient dietary. Further it may also result in thin, lanky bodies in\\nteens.\\n\\nProtein deficiency during pregnancy may result in stress, which could give rise to complications\\nsuch as vomitting, swelling of feet, etc. If these symptoms are commonly prevalent, they are accepted\\nas a normal part of pregnancy. Some think it is a hereditary condition. Thus due to ignorance, protein\\ndeficiency in pregnancy may not be detected and thus there will be no improvement in the diet. This\\ncondition may not be restricted to low socio-economic groups. It may adversely affect the growth of\\nthe foetus and foetal stores for future. Thus the infant’s survival and health are affected by maternal\\nnutrition. In children, lack of protein in the diet results in stunted growth and low weight.\\n\\nSevere Deficiency: If there is severe deficiency of protein in the first two years of life, it could\\naffect mental development, learning ability and behaviour.\\n\\nIn India and other tropical developing countries, protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is a common\\ndisorder during childhood. When the child is weaned, the diet often does not contain an adequate\\n\\n\\n\\n6868686868 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nquantity and quality of protein which results in deficiency diseases. When an infant is fed high\\ncarbohydrate low protein foods such as ogi (corn starch porridge) as in West Africa, kwashiorkor, a\\ntypical protein deficiency condition occurs. When both protein and calorie are very low in the diet,\\nnutritional marasmus could occur. In other words, kwashiorkor is a deficiency disease due to severe\\nlack of protein but nutritional marasmus is due to sheer starvation (Figure 6.2).\\n\\nThe education of prospective parents about childcare and nutrition can ensure good nutrition of\\ninfants and young children and prevent protein-calorie malnutrition. Greater attention is needed to\\nappropriate supplementary nutrition for children in the 0–2 age group, the most critical period in terms\\nof brain and body growth.\\n\\nStudy Questions and Activities\\n\\n1. List the functions of proteins and discuss these.\\n2. What are essential amino acids?\\n3.

Energy exists in a number of forms. It may occur as heat generated\\nby chemical, mechanical or electrical means. Examples are:\\n\\n1. Heat produced by chemical means, e.g., when lime and water are mixed.\\n2. Heat produced mechanically in the grinding stone when cereals are ground.\\n3. Heat generated by electric current for boiling water in a tea kettle.\\n\\nOne form of energy can be converted to another form.\\nIn physiology and nutrition, energy is defined as the capacity of a body to do work. Just as a\\n\\nmachine needs fuel to keep it operating, the body needs food to provide the energy to perform its\\nvarious tasks.\\n\\nThe energy released in the body from food is measured as a unit of heat the kilocalorie (kcal). By\\ndefinition, one kilocalorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogramme of\\nwater through one degree centigrade (i.e., from 14.5° to 15.5.°C).\\n\\nSome efforts have been made to introduce the joule (J)1 as a unit of energy. One joule is equal to\\nthe energy expended when one kilogramme is moved through one meter by a force of one newton (N).\\nBut joule cannot be used in practical nutrition, until food composition  tables are prepared giving the\\nenergy value of foods in joules, and RDA are set in joules.\\n\\nIt must be remembered that the human body uses energy in many forms hence the unit used in\\nmeasurement is only an indirect indication of the energy available to the body in various forms (chemical,\\nthermal, mechanical, electrical, etc.).\\n\\nFood supplies the energy we need for everything we do. Two components of food, carbohydrates\\nand fats, supply 85 to 92 per cent of the total energy in the Indian dietary, the rest is provided by\\nproteins.\\n\\nMeasurement of Food Energy\\n\\nThe energy value of foods is determined in the laboratories by the use of special equipment called\\nthe bomb calorimeter. In the bomb calorimeter, the heat given off by a food in direct combustion or\\nburning, is measured under conntrolled conditions.\\n\\nEnergy value of a food can also be measured indirectly by measuring the oxygen used in burning\\na known amount of food.\\n\\n1. 1 kilocalorie = 4.184 kilojoules (kJ)\\n1000 joules = 1 kilojoule (kJ)\\n1000 kilojoules – 1 megajoule (mJ).\\n\\n\\n\\n7272727272 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n1. The coefficient of digestibility is a measure of digestion and is calculated as follows\\n\\nCoefficient of digestibility = \\n(Nutrient intake - Nutrient in faeces)  100\\n\\nNutrient intake\\n×\\n\\nThe average fuel values of the energy giving components of foods have been found to be:\\nCarbohydrates 4.10 kcals/gramme\\nFats 9.45 kcals/gramme and\\nProteins 5.65 kcals/gramme\\n\\nThe energy available from food in the body, called the physiological fuel value, is less than its fuel\\nvalue given above because:\\n\\n• Some partially oxidised products are excreted.\\n• Some food is excreted in undigested form.\\n\\nThe carbohydrates and fats (after digestion) are completely oxidised in the body, but some partially\\noxidised end products of proteins are excreted in the urine. The energy value of these end products on\\nan average is equivalent to 1.25 kcals/gramme of protein consumed. This figure is derived from a\\nnormal American diet about sixty years back. This correction is made in calculating energy available\\nfrom proteins in the body.\\n\\nThe averages of coefficients of digestibility1 for the components of a typical dietary were:\\nCarbohydrates 98%\\nFats 95%\\nProteins 92%\\n\\nThe physiological fuel value (i.e., the energy available to the body) was calculated as follows:\\nCarbohydrates = (4.10) × 98% = 4.01 kcal/g\\n\\nFats = (9.45) × 95% = 8.98 kcal/g\\nProteins = (5.65 – 1.25) × 92% = 4.05 kcal/g\\n\\nFor practical use these physiological fuel values were rounded off to the nearest whole number to\\nget the kcalorie values we use in practical nutrition.\\n\\nTable 7.1: Calorie Content of Dal\\n\\nComponents Dal Calories per g a × b\\na b\\n\\nCarbohydrates 57.6 4 230.4\\n\\nFats 1.7 9 15.3\\n\\nProteins 22.3 4 89.2\\n\\nMoisture 13.4 0 0\\n\\nMinerals 3.5 0 0\\n\\nFibre 1.5 0 0\\n\\nCalories per 100.0 g of Dal = 334.9\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Metabolism 7373737373\\n\\nCarbohydrates 4 kcals / g\\nFats 9 kcals / g\\nProteins 4 kcals / g\\n\\nPlease remember that these fuel values refer to the edible portion of the food. Thus firstly, the\\nenergy content of the food is related to the food composition. Table 7.1 illustrates how to calculate the\\nfuel value of food on the basis of composition.\\n\\nSecondly, energy value of food is affected by water or moisture content of food, as it is given in\\nthe food composition tables. As you may note from Table 7.2, water or moisture does not provide any\\nenergy. Therefore foods, which have a large percentage of water, have a low calorie content.\\n\\nThirdly, energy content of foods varies with their fat content. As we learnt earlier, fat provides 9\\nkcals per gramme, therefore foods with high fat content, have a high energy value (Table 7.2).\\n\\nFourthly, the energy value of foods is affected by preparation or processing. As rice absorbs\\nwater, while cooking, cooked rice has about one-third the number of calories as an equal weight of raw\\nrice. The reverse is the case when foods are dried. Dried fruits are concentrated source of energy as\\ncompared to fresh fruits. Seasoning with oil increases the energy content of salads, vegetables and\\ndals. Frying foods such as papad, shev, wafers, invariably increases their energy content. Examples of\\neffect of preparation on energy content of foods is presented in Table 7.3.\\n\\nThus any change in the composition during processing or preparation affects the calorie content\\nof the food product. It is important to take these changes into account, while calculating the energy\\ncontent of food preparations, used in the dietary.\\n\\nTable 7.2: Moisture, Fat and Caloric Content of Foods\\n\\nFood Moisture Fat % Calories\\n% per 100 g\\n\\nCucumber 96 0.1 13\\n\\nTomato 94 0.2 20\\n\\nFrench beans 91 0.1 26\\n\\nOrange, Carrot 88 0.2 48\\n\\nMilk, cow’s 87 4.1 67\\n\\nGrapes 79 0.3 71\\n\\nPotato 75 0.1 97\\n\\nEgg 73 13.3 173\\n\\nMutton, muscle 71 13.3 194\\n\\nWheat 13 1.5 346\\n\\nGroundnut (Peanuts) 3 40.1 567\\n\\nButter 19 81.0 729\\n\\nOil, Ghee or Vanaspati 0 100.0 900\\n\\n\\n\\n7474747474 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nTable 7.3: Change in Calorie Content with Preparation & Processing\\n\\nFood Moisture % Fat % Calories\\nper 100 g\\n\\nRice, raw 13 0.5 345\\n\\nRice, cooked 71 0.2 115\\n\\nGrapes 79 0.3 71\\n\\nRaisins (dry grapes) 20 0.3 308\\n\\nMethi leaves, fresh 86 0.9 49\\n\\nMethi leaves bhaji 80 8.0 113\\n\\nPapad, roasted 20 0.3 228\\n\\nPapad, fried 3 26.0 512\\n\\nBengal gram dal flour 10 5.6 372\\n\\nShev (made from besan) 3 38.0 568\\n\\nCalorie Density\\n\\nThe word density is derived from dense, which refers to the extent of concentration of a material\\nin a particular substance. Thus calorie density indicates the concentration of energy (calorie) in a food.\\nFat or foods containing fat have a higher calorie density than those containing carbohydrate or proteins.\\nIf you refer to Table 7.3, you will observe that fried papad is calorie dense as compared to roasted\\npapad.\\n\\nEnergy Intake\\n\\nThe main source of energy for all the body activities is food, along with the energy store in body\\ntissues as reserve.\\n\\nOur body needs fuel to carry out its work on a continual basis. This need starts at birth and\\ncontinues as long as one lives.\\n\\nEnergy is the primary need of the body and takes precedence over all other needs. The metabolic\\nproducts formed by digestion of carbohydrates and fats, which are simple sugars, glycerol and fatty\\nacids, provide most of the energy needs of the body. One can summarise the energy production from\\nfoods as:\\n\\nGlucose, fatty acids, glycerol or amino acids + oxygen →\\n→  energy + carbon dioxide + water\\n\\nThe actual process involves a series of complex reactions, which lead to the common pathway\\nknown as Kreb’s cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle, its end products being energy, carbon  dioxide\\nand water. The energy released is trapped in energy-rich compounds (ATP), from which it is released\\nas required.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Metabolism 7575757575\\n\\nFood Energy Intake: You can calculate your own energy intake by keeping an accurate record\\nof a day’s actual food consumption. A sample form given in Table 7.4, can be used and energy value of\\nfoods eaten can be calculated by referring to food composition table in the appendix (Appendix F).\\n\\nEnergy Storage in the Body\\n\\nWhile we may eat two, three or four meals a day, which supply energy to the body at intervals,\\nour body activities (voluntary and involuntary) go on throughout the day, even while we sleep. The\\nbody draws on its stores of energy to meet its continuous need for energy.\\n\\nGlycogen: Glycogen stored in the muscles and liver (about 300–350 g), acts as an energy reserve.\\nGlycogen stores maintain blood glucose at normal levels for use of body functions during hours of\\nsleep. Thus our first meal of the day, which breaks the night long fast, is very important for replenishing\\nglycogen stores.\\n\\nTable 7.4: Record of Food Energy Intake\\n\\nList all meals and snacks for 1 day:\\n\\nFood Carbohydrates Fat Protein K calories\\n(description and amount) (g) (g) (g)\\n\\nBreakfast\\n\\nLunch\\n\\nSnacks\\n\\nDinner\\n\\nSnacks\\n\\nTOTAL\\n\\nAdipose tissue: Food energy in excess of body’s needs is stored efficiently in the adipose\\ntissues. This store is larger than glycogen stores. The amount thus stored varies from person to\\nperson. A well balanced amount needs to be maintained as an added reserve energy source.\\n\\nMuscle mass: In the muscle mass, a limited amount of energy is stored as protein. This lean\\nmuscle mass needs to be maintained for good health. The body draws on these tissues for energy, only\\nwhen it is under stress due to long periods of fast or starvation.\\n\\n\\n\\n7676767676 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nEnergy Expenditure\\n\\nOur body spends the energy from food and body reserves to carry out its functions related to\\nmaintenance of life and to carry out physical activities. The energy expenditure of adults is decided by\\nthree types of needs for energy: basal metabolism, physical activity and use of food in the body.\\n\\nMeasurement of Energy Expenditure\\n\\nEnergy expended by the human body at rest or in activity can be measured directly by measuring\\nthe heat evolved. This is known as direct calorimetry, which is easy in principle, but very cumbersome\\nin practice. It needs a small insulated chamber in which the human subject is kept and all the heat\\nproduced is accurately measured. There may be less than ten such equipments in research laboratories\\nin the world. Atwater and Ross about hundred years back, studied human energy metabolism, using\\nsuch a chamber. They were able to demonstrate that in man.\\n\\n1. The fundamental physical law of Conservation of Energy is obeyed. Thus total energy\\nexpenditure (heat produced + activity done) is equal to the net energy provided by the food\\nconsumed (total chemical energy in the food – the energy lost in faeces and urine), when the\\nperson is in energy balance.\\n\\n2. Total energy expenditure is quantitatively related to the oxygen consumption in man.\\nTotal energy spent is quanatitatively related to the oxygen used in the body. The oxygen consumed\\n\\nwhen an organic substance is completely used (oxidised) in the body is proportional to the energy\\nreleased as heat. Hence the measurement of oxygen consumption by the body can be used to determine\\nenergy spent by the body at rest (BMR) or in various activities. This is an indirect way to determine\\nenergy expenditure and is therefore, known as indirect calorimetry.\\n\\nThe oxidation of glucose proceeds quantitatively as follows:\\n\\nC6H12O6 + 6O2 →  6CO2 + 6H2O + Heat\\n\\nThe ratio of carbon dioxide produced to the oxygen used is known as respiratory quotient (RQ).\\nThe RQ for oxidation of glucose is 1.0. Similarly the RQ for protein is 0.8 and for fat 0.7, indicating\\nthat more oxygen is needed to oxidise proteins and fats than that needed to oxidise carbohydrates.\\n\\nEnergy for Basal Metabolism\\nEnergy needs of the body at rest is called basal metabolism. It can also be aptly be called the cost\\n\\nof living. A number of processes go on to ensure the continuance of life without any conscious effort.\\nThese include the beating of heart, the circulation  of the blood, breathing, the regulation of body\\ntemperature, glandular activities, etc. These processes are known as the basal metabolic processes.\\n\\nBasal energy expenditure (BEE) or resting energy expenditure (REE) is the energy used by the\\nbody at rest. The energy used is measured as the basal metabolic rate (BMR) or resting metabolic rate\\n(RMR). The terms are used interchangeably.\\n\\nThe basal energy needs account for, about 60 per cent of the total energy requirement for most\\npeople. The highly active tissues (liver, brain, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal tract), which form less\\nthan 5 per cent of the body weight, use about 60 to 70 per cent of the basal metabolic energy. The rest\\nof the tissues, which account for most of the body weight, need much less energy to maintain their\\nbasal function.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Metabolism 7777777777\\n\\nMeasurement of Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)\\n\\nThe BMR is normally measured early in the morning, after the subject awakens and is in a post-\\nabsorptive state (10 to 12 hours after the last meal).\\n\\nIn clinical cases, the normal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in regular breathing used to\\nbe measured with a calorimeter to determine the BMR. The amount of energy used to be calculated\\nfrom the oxygen used. This test is used only in research now.\\n\\nA number of new efficient tests are used in clinical practice currently. These tests measure the\\nactivity of the thyroid gland. There are several ways of measuring the activity of thyroid gland, which\\nproduces the hormone thyroxine. The blood levels of thyroxine, the hormone which controls the BMR,\\ncan be measured. Iodine is used in the synthesis of the thyroid hormone. Hence serum levels of\\nprotein-bound iodine (PBI) and radioactive iodine uptake tests are also used to determine BMR.\\n\\nBasal energy needs can be estimated using a general formula 1 kcal/kg body weight per hour for\\nmen and 0.9 kcal/kg body weight per hour for women.\\n\\nThe classic Harris-Benedict equations are also used to estimate the basal or resting energy needs\\nof adult hospitalised patients.\\n\\nFemale REE = 655 + (9.56 × W) + (1.85 × H) – (4.68 × A)\\nMale REE = 66.5 + (13.8 × W) + (5.0 × H) – (6.76 × A)\\nWhere W = weight in Kilogrammes (kg), H = height in centimeters (cm) an A = age in years\\nFactors affecting the BMR: Body size and composition, age and growth, sleep, state of nutrition,\\n\\nclimate and certain ailments affect the basal requirement.\\nBody Size and Composition: The heat loss from the body is related to body size; energy needed\\n\\nto maintain lean muscle mass at rest is related to body composition.\\nOriginal work on energy measurement was based on body surface area. Recent studies have\\n\\ndemonstrated that the metabolic rate is primarily dependent on lean body mass (LBM). LBM can be\\naccurately determined by under water weighing or total count of body potassium.\\n\\nAthletes, who have developed muscles due to exercise, have 5 per cent increase in BMR as\\ncompared to non-athletes. Women have 5 to 10 per cent lower metabolic rate as compared to men of\\nsame weight and height, because they have more fat and less muscle in their body than men do. If BMR\\nis calculated on the basis of lean body mass, there is no difference between men and women.\\n\\nAge: There is a decrease in metabolic energy expenditure of 2 to 3 per cent per decade after early\\nadulthood, due to the shift in the proportion of muscle to fat in the body. The basal metabolic rate\\ngradually decreases after reaching adulthood; the decrease is about 30 per cent betwen 30 and 75 years\\nof age.\\n\\nGrowth and Repair: The metabolic rate is highest in the stages of rapid growth, namely the first\\nand second years of life. There is a lesser peak in metabolic rate in the years of puberty and adolescence\\nin both sexes. Infants may store 12 to 15 per cent of their energy intake in the form of new tissue. The\\nmetabolic rate increases in pregnancy due to growth of the foetus and related increased growth activity.\\n\\nSleep: The metabolic rate falls by about 10 per cent while sleeping as compared to the resting\\nrate when awake. This is due to relaxation of muscles and reduced activity of the nervous system\\nduring sleep.\\n\\nState of Health: The metabolism is decreased due to malnutrition; the decrease in basal metabolism\\nis proportional to the degree of malnutrition. It is mainly due to decrease in the amount of active tissue\\nand a decrease in the metabolic rate.\\n\\n\\n\\n7878787878 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nWhen one suffers from fever, the increase in temperature of the body increases metabolism. The\\nincrease is about 7 per cent per each degree Fahrenheit above normal (98.6°F or 37°C).\\n\\nHormonal Control: A hormone known as thyroxine, controls the speed of our involuntary\\nactivity. The thyroid gland, situated in our neck, synthesises this hormone.\\n\\nIf too much thyroxine is released, the rate of energy expenditure is increased; if too little is\\nreleased, the energy expenditure is reduced. The basal metabolism may decrease by 30 to 40 per cent\\nwhen the synthesis of thyroxine is inadequate. On the other hand, the BMR may almost double due to\\na hyperactive thyroid gland. These conditions need prompt medical treatment.\\n\\nLuckily for most of us such abnormalities are not very common. Most of us have a normally\\nfunctioning thyroid gland and hence a normal basal metabolic rate.\\n\\nClimate: Extreme environmental temperatures affect the metabolic energy needs. The metabolic\\nrate of persons in the tropics is 5 to 20 per cent higher than those in temperate regions.\\n\\nIn hot climate (if the temperature is greater than 86°F), the metabolic rate increases by about 50\\nper cent due to increased activity of sweat glands. The increase in metabolic rate due to cold depends\\non the body fat insulation and use of warm clothes.\\n\\nEnergy for Physical Activity\\n\\nPhysical activity is that activity, which we choose to do; so it is also known as voluntary activity.\\nIt includes;\\n\\n• the work related to one’s occupation, profession or job.\\n• activities related to personal necessities, such as bathing, brushing teeth, dressing, eating,\\n\\nwashing clothes and utensils, commuting to work, market, etc.\\n• leisure activities such as reading, watching television, playing games (badminton, tennis),\\n\\ngardening, playing with children, walking, etc.\\nThe energy cost of some common activities in terms of BMR units is given in Table 7.5.\\nPlease remember that energy spent in these activities is in addition to that used for basal metabolism.\\n\\nThe total energy needed for physical activities includes that spent in personal necessities, professional\\nwork, housework and leisure activities.\\n\\nThe additional energy output due to voluntary physical activity varies from as little as 10 per cent\\nfor a bed-ridden patient to as high as 50 per cent for an athlete. Factors, which affect energy need for\\nactivities, are body size, the efficiency in activity and level of fitness of the person.\\n\\nMental work or study does not need extra energy. Similarly, anxiety or any other emotional state\\ndoes not increase energy needs, but any agitated movements, muscle tension or restlessness may\\nrequire extra energy.\\n\\nTypical disposal of food energy is presented in Figure 7.0.\\n\\nEnergy for Utilisation of Food\\n\\nSome energy is used to take food into the body, digest it and carry the nutrients to the tissues and\\neliminate the waste products produced in the process. This is known as the specific dynamic action of\\nfoods or the energy for utilisation of food.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Metabolism 7979797979\\n\\nActivity\\n\\nTable 7.5: Energy Cost of Some Common Activities in Terms of  BMR Units.1\\n\\nEnergy cost of activities in BMR units\\n\\nIndian data International data\\n\\nSitting quietly 1.20 1.25\\n\\nStanding quietly 1.40 1.33\\n\\nSitting at desk 1.30 1.36\\n\\nStanding and doing lab work 2.0 1.95\\n\\nHarvesting 3.6 3.5\\n\\nHand saw 7.4 7.5\\n\\nTyping (sitting) 1.58 1.69\\n\\nWalking 3 MPH 3.71 3.77\\n\\n1.  BMR of man = 1.05 kcal/hr/kg and woman = 0.975 kcal/hr/kg.\\n\\nThe energy required for the utilisation of mixed diets in Western countries is reported to be 6 to\\n10 per cent of the total energy need. The energy needed for the utilisation of the carbohydrate-based\\nIndian diet may be lower than that percentage.\\n\\nFigure 7.0: Typical disposal of food energy\\n\\n\\n\\n8080808080 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nEnergy for Growth and Repair: Extra energy is needed during periods of rapid growth for the\\nbuilding of new tissues. These stages of life include pregnancy, early childhood and adolescence.\\n\\nThe total energy need of one pregnancy is estimated to be about 40,000 kilocalories. In the\\nlactation stage, the secretion of milk for the infant increases the mother’s need for energy, the additional\\nneed is in the range 700 to 1000 kilocalories per day.\\n\\nInfants, whose growth rate is the highest in the entire life-cycle, have been observed to store 12\\nto 15 per cent of their total energy intake. Adolescent growth spurt results in extra need for energy; it\\nmay be as high as 25 to 30 per cent more than the adult needs.\\n\\nPersons, recovering from wasting diseases, from burns, from blood loss, etc., need additional\\nenergy for replacing the tissue damaged or lost with new tissues.\\n\\nTotal Energy Requirements\\n\\nThe number of calories we need each day is decided by the involuntary as well as the voluntary\\nactivities of our body. The total energy needed for our body daily is the sum total of the energy for\\n\\n1. Basal metabolic processes, which are involuntary\\n2. Muscular (physical) activity, which is voluntary\\n3. Utilisation of food or specific dynamic action of foods and\\n4. Energy for growth and repair.\\n\\nTo maintain daily energy balance, food energy intake must be equal to body’s energy expenditure\\nin a healthy adult.\\n\\nLoss of weight excessively, as in anorexia nervosa, results from deficient intake of food energy\\nover a long period of time. Treatment consists of counselling about food needs for health, gradual\\nincrease in food intake as also moderate activity and rest.\\n\\nEnergy Balance\\n\\nIn an adult, a balance between energy supplied by food and the energy used by the body for its\\nactivities, ensures maintenance of ideal weight and good health. Thus underweight and overweight are\\nstates, which indicate the extent of imbalance in body’s energy needs and energy intake.\\n\\nEnergy balance is the level of energy intake of an individual from food that will balance energy\\nexpenditure and maintain body weight, when he/she is healthy and maintains body weight and has a\\nbody size, body composition and level of activity consistent with good health.\\n\\nIn growth stages, such as childhood, pregnancy and lactation, the energy requirement includes\\nenergy needed for growth or the formation of tissue or the secretion of milk at rates consistent with\\ngood health.\\n\\nThe ICMR expert committee adopted the FAO/WHO procedure of using BMR factors for arriving\\nat the energy requirements of Indian reference man and woman. These BMR factors for Indian men\\nand women engaged in sedentary, moderate and heavy activity are 1.6, 1.9 and 2.5 respectively. The\\nenergy requirement of Reference Indian man and woman as given in RDA 1990 is presented in Table\\n7.6.\\n\\nFor individuals with different body weights, the energy needs can be computed from the above\\nfigures arithmetically.\\n\\nEnergy requirement decreases with age beyond 30 years, due to gradual decrease in basal metabolic\\nrate. By 75 years of age, the decrease is about 30 per cent.\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Metabolism 8181818181\\n\\nTable 7.6: Energy Requirement of Reference Indian\\n\\nSex Activity Body weight Energy\\n(kg) (kcal)\\n\\nSedentary 60 2425\\nMan Moderate 60 2875\\n\\nHeavy 60 3800\\n\\nSedentary 50 1875\\nWoman Moderate 50 2225\\n\\nHeavy 50 2925\\n\\nCut-off Point for Assessing Energy Inadequacy\\n\\nDuring famine and drought situations, scarcity of food and work exists. An individual’s energy\\nintake can go below the cut-off point. It is important to set-up a cut-off point for energy for determining\\nthe extent of energy inadequacy. The cut-off point derived from weighted average of daily energy\\nrequirement for entire population on the basis of present RDA will be 2,200 kcal. The same cut-off\\npoint can b e used to determine the extent of poverty and energy inadequacy in our population.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\\n\\nThe recommended dietary allowances for energy are given in Table 7.7. It may be observed that\\nin adults the energy intake is related to the physical activity (Figure 7.1). The energy need for pregnancy\\n\\nTable 7.7: Recommended Daily Allowances for Energy\\n\\nParticulars kcal/day Particulars kcal/day\\n\\nMan (60 kg) Infants\\nSedentary work 2425 0–6 months (5.4 kg) 108/kg\\nModerate work 2875 6–12 months (8.6 kg) 98/kg\\nHeavy work 3800 Children\\n\\nWoman (50 kg) 1–3 years (12.2 kg) 1240\\nSedentary work 1875 4–6 years (19.0 kg) 1690\\nModerate work 2225 7–9 years (26.9 kg) 1950\\nHeavy work 2925 Boys 10–12 years (35.4 kg) 2190\\nPregnant woman +300 Girls 10–12 years (31.5 kg) 1970\\n\\nLactation Boys 13–15 years (47.8 kg) 2450\\n0–6 months +550 Girls 13–15 years (46.7 kg) 2060\\n7–12 months +400 Boys 16–18 years (57.1 kg) 2640\\n\\nGirls 16–18 years (49.9 kg) 2060\\n\\n\\n\\n8282828282 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nis increased in the latter half when the growth is rapid and some storage occurs to be utilised during the\\nearly part of the lactation for the secretion of milk. The extra energy needs for pregnancy and lactation\\nare indicated below, as also the energy needs during various stages of growth. In the first year of life\\nas the growth is very rapid and individual variation in weight is great, the recommendation is made in\\nterms of energy per unit weight (kcal/kg). The growth rate slows from the second year of life and so\\nalso the energy need per day. The variation in energy needs with occupation and physiological state is\\ndepicted in Figure 7.2.\\n\\nFigure 7.1: Energy needs vary with activity.\\n\\nFigure 7.2: Energy needs vary with age, occupation and physiological state.\\n\\nInsufficient Energy Supply\\n\\nThe effects of insufficient energy supply throughout life may result in low life expectancy. For a\\nlarge section of the rural population, who do not get sufficient food, the cause may be traced to too\\nmany persons per unit of family land; poor yields or poor harvests; the landless labour may have no\\n\\n1950 Calories 2225 Calories 2875 Calories 2225 Calories\\n\\nAge – 7-8 months\\nCalories – 845\\nBody Weight – 8.6 kg\\n\\n9 years\\n1950\\n26.9 kg\\n\\n25 years Sedentary\\n1875\\n50 kg\\n\\nPregnant\\n2175\\n60 kg\\n\\nModerate Activity\\n2225\\n50 kg\\n\\n\\n\\nEnergy Metabolism 8383838383\\n\\nwork during part of the year. In the cities the causes may be full or partial unemployment or too many\\ndependents per earning member in the lower socio-economic groups. A small section of the population\\nmay have insufficient intake due to faulty food habits. These may include missed meals, poor schedules,\\nneglect or poor health practices.\\n\\nEffects of Insufficient Energy Supply\\n\\nThe effects of insufficient energy supply vary with the age group affected and the extent of\\ninsufficiency. In adults, it may affect their capacity for work, in children it affects their growth and\\nactivity. If the energy supply is very short of what is needed, the body stores of fat may be used,\\nfollowed by use of the muscle tissues to meet the need for minimal function of the body.\\n\\nWorking Capacity: The energy needs for work are next to the basal metabolic needs in magnitude.\\nWhen there is an insufficient energy supply, the body adjusts to the shortage by reducing activity.\\n\\nIn children, this may result in reduced movement or play, depending on the age of the child and\\nmay pass unnoticed. In adults, it results in reduced activity, slow deliberate movement and avoidance\\nof continuous effort.\\n\\nIn a number of studies, dramatic losses in working efficiency have been reported, during periods\\nof food shortage. In Germany, steel output fell from 120 tons to 80 tons per man per month, when\\nenergy supply for work was reduced from 1900 to 1150 calories per day.\\n\\nIn India, where about 65 to 70 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture, it will affect\\nthe agricultural production adversely.\\n\\nWasting of Tissue: When adults have to do strenuous manual work with meagre food intake, the\\nextra energy needed is mobilised by burning body tissues. This has been euphemistically called ‘wasting\\nof tissue’. This is what happens to many farm workers who have very little food reserves. When the\\nplanting season comes, and they have to go through the whole cycle of strenuous operations involved\\nin producing the crop, with meagre food intakes.\\n\\nThe wasting of tissues is observed in adults in pre-harvest periods in many farming communities.\\nThis population goes through the cycle of want annually. What it means in terms of loss of potential\\nhuman resources and human misery is hard to estimate.\\n\\nThe women folk in these communities, who have the additional burden of child-bearing, are\\nsubjected to greater stress and it is bound to affect the health of the mother and the child adversely.\\n\\nStunted Growth: It has been observed that underfed mothers tend to have smaller babies, who\\nhave very little reserves of nutrients at birth. Inadequate food during infancy results in stunted growth.\\n\\nUnfortunately, as most children in such communities suffer from a similar problem, the retarded\\ngrowth may not be noticed by the parents. Thus the subnormal may pass for normal growth. This is\\nnot a malady in itself, but insufficient food intake is not only deficient in energy, but in other nutrients,\\nmaking the child vulnerable to diseases.\\n\\nAny childhood infection such as diarrhoea, dysentery, measles, chicken pox creates a stress and\\nthe body tissues are used up to meet the extra demands imposed by the infection. The child may not\\nsurvive, if it suffers from repeated attacks of such infections, in the absence of improved quantity and\\nquality of food intake.\\n\\nAged persons, in such families may also suffer from tissue wastage, as they are dependent on\\ntheir relatives, who are unable to provide food for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n8484848484 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nMaintenance of Body Weight\\n\\nWeight is one of the gross parameters of our health. The life insurance companies collected data\\nabout weights for heights of healthy individuals to set-up norms (of weights for heights) to be used as\\nguides in the medical examination of their clients. The clients, who were overweight or underweight\\nwere found to be greater risks, and therefore had to pay higher premiums. Thus overweight can be a\\nfinancial liability.\\n\\nA healthy normal person reaches the desirable weight for his/her height by 25 years of age. It is\\nadvisable for a person to maintain that weight throughout life. This is the reason why all tables indicate\\ndesirable weight for height for men and women at 25 years (Tables 7.8 and 7.9).\\n\\nWhen energy intake is equal to body needs, body weight is maintained at a fairly constant level, in\\na healthy adult. Thus constant body weight is an index of energy balance in healthy adults.\\n\\nConsistent intake of inadequate food, which is unable to meet the body’s need for energy, leads to\\nuse of body fat to make up the deficit and there is loss of weight. An underweight person has reduced\\ncapacity for work, vitality and decreased resistance to disease.\\n\\nOn the contrary, continuous intake of energy in excess of one’s needs, results in deposition of\\nfat. If this practice is continued, the gain in weight may be unsightly. Overweight is associated with\\nailments of heart, circulatory system, kidneys and diabetes. Please remember that there is no reason for\\na person to weigh more when he is 40 than what he weighed at 25 years of age. The same is true of\\nlater years.\\n\\nTable 7.8: Males (25 yrs.)

Overweight and underweight limits have been calculated from weight in column 2, by adding or\\n\\n subtracting 20 per cent.\\n\\nExcess Energy Intake\\n\\nContinued increase in weight in a healthy adult after the age of 25, indicates intake of energy in\\nexcess of body needs. The body has no mechanism to rid itself of this extra energy and therefore\\nstores it in the form of fat.\\n\\nThe excess intake does not have to be large. It can be as little as 50 extra calories a day, which\\nwhen taken regularly, will result in 2 kilogram gain in weight in a year. This gain is not serious in the\\nshort run, but over a decade it adds up to 20 kilogram, which is when it becomes noticeable.\\n\\nMost people add weight after the age of 35 or 40 years, because they continue the energy intakes\\nthat they needed at the age of 25 years. But their need for energy decreases with age, due to the\\nlowering of the basal metabolic rate and perhaps change in the activities from more active ones to less\\nactive ones.\\n\\nMost women are less active at this age, as the children are of school-going age and do not need\\nthe kind of care they needed as babies. Both men and women may be more efficient in whatever jobs\\nthey do and may have given up active exercise or sport for sedentary entertainment like playing bridge\\nor watching television. This is also a stage where people can afford the luxuries of life such as eating\\nrich and expensive foods. Thus, there is an intake of excess food energy which is not utilised, and is\\ndeposited as fat.\\n\\n\\n\\n8686868686 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIt is necessary to reduce energy intake to a level lower than one’s needs, to use up the deposited\\nfat. Exercise in the form of active outdoor games, walking and indoor fitness exercise help in weight\\nreduction. But it must be accompanied by consistent, regular, carefully planned reduction of energy\\nintake.\\n\\nStudy Questions and Activities\\n\\n1. List the nutrients, which supply energy.

Thus half the\\nsailors, in the fifteenth to seventeenth century voyages, died of scurvy, due to lack of fresh vegetables\\nand fruits in their diets. In Asia, beriberi plagued rice-eating people. Pellagra claimed many lives of\\ncorn-eating population in Southern United States in the beginning of last century.\\n\\n\\n\\n8888888888 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nToday we rarely see these deadly diseases in the sections of society, who have varied diets of\\nordinary natural foods. But in over 70 developing countries, crores of children still lose their sight due\\nto lack of vitamin A.\\n\\nIt was thought that a diet containing proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals and water was adequate\\nto maintain life, until the beginning of last century. But research conducted in the early part of the last\\ncentury proved that some vital factor was missing from the diet. This vital factor was given the name\\nvitamin. Later it was found that there was more than one factor involved.\\n\\nNow we know that vitamins are one of the six classes of nutrients supplied by food. They are\\nrequired for normal growth and maintenance of all animal life. Vitamins are important for their regulatory\\nand protective functions. Unlike most other nutrients they are required in very small amounts. But it is\\nnecessary to provide these in the diet because many of them cannot be manufactured by the body. The\\nlack of vitamins results in definite deficiency disorders, which are specific for each particular vitamin.\\n\\nVitamins have captured public interest in the last sixty years. This may be because they have been\\nsynthesised and marketed by a large pharmaceutical industry. Their efforts have been supported by\\nmedical practitioners and health conscious public. Some people have often been misled into thinking ‘if\\nlittle is good, more may be better’.\\n\\nSurely vitamins are essential nutrients. We need to understand what they do, how much we need\\nthem and where we can get them. Can we get enough of these in foods or do we need pills to meet our\\nneeds of some vitamins? Most important, can mega-doses of vitamins hurt us? We need sound answers\\nto these questions.\\n\\nDefinition\\nA substance can be classified as a vitamin if it satisfies the two criteria:\\n1. It must be a vital, organic dietary substance, which is neither a carbohydrate, fat, protein, or\\n\\nmineral and is necessary in only very small amounts to perform a specific metabolic function\\nor to prevent an associated deficiency disease, and\\n\\n2. It cannot be manufactured by the body, and, therefore, must be supplied by the diet.\\n\\nNature of Vitamins\\n\\nVitamins are organic substances, which occur in small amounts in foods. They are necessary for\\nlife and growth. Chemical structure of each vitamin is specific; some like vitamin C have a simple\\nstructure, while others such as vitamin D have a complex structure.\\n\\nVitamins do not provide calories, but are essential in the metabolic reactions, which release energy\\nfrom carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Vitamins are essential co-factors in hundreds of metabolic\\nreactions in the body. They may act singly or in co-ordination with each other. Each vitamin has\\nspecific functions and so one vitamin cannot substitute for another in the body.\\n\\nVitamins may occur in preformed or its active form in the food, or as a precursor compound\\nwhich can be changed into active form in the body.\\n\\nVitamins are conveniently classified into two groups on the basis of their solubility into fat-\\nsoluble and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins include A, D, E and K. Water-soluble vitamins\\ninclude the B-group and vitamin C.\\n\\nFoods differ greatly in the amount and kinds of the vitamins they supply. Selection and intake of\\nfoods according to the food guide (chapter 14) can help to meet one’s need of the various vitamins.\\n\\n\\n\\nFat-soluble Vitamins 8989898989\\n\\nFat-Soluble Vitamins\\n\\nFat-soluble vitamins can only be absorbed in the presence of fat. Therefore, the presence of some\\nfat in the diet is essential for their absorption. Fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body and hence\\noccasional intake of very high sources may help the body tide over periods of low intake. The requirement\\nfor fat-soluble vitamins may be met by intake of a precursor or the vitamin itself. Not much of fat-\\nsoluble vitamins are lost in normal cooking procedures.\\n\\nVitamin A\\n\\nThis was the first fat-soluble vitamin to be discovered. It has a number of important functions in\\nthe body. Vitamin A is found only in animal foods, mainly as retinol. Plants provide a source of vitamin\\nA for animals in the form of orange-yellow pigments called the carotenoids. The  chief source in\\nhuman nutrition is beta-carotene, which the body converts to vitamin A in the intestinal mucosa during\\nabsorption. The conversion is partial and varies from 25 to 50 per cent.\\n\\nVitamin A activity in foods used to be expressed in International Units (I.U.), with the following\\nequivalencies:\\n\\n1 IU = 0.3 mcg retinol\\n1 IU = 0.6 mcg beta-carotene\\n1 IU = 1.2 mcg other provitamin A carotenoids\\n\\nNow it is expressed as microgram (mcg) of retinol or beta-carotene or retinol equivalent (RE) as\\nindicated in Table 8.1.\\n\\nAs, you may have noted, the amount of vitamin ester and carotenoids provided decreases with\\nincreasing weight of the vitamin A compound. About 6 to 12 times weight of carotenoids are needed to\\nprovide one unit RE, depending on the form present.\\n\\nTable 8.1: Retinol Equivalents (RE)1 of Vitamin A Compound and Carotenoids\\n\\nCompound mcg IU/mcg mcg/RE\\n\\nAll-trans retinol2 0.300 3.33 1.00\\n\\nAll-trans retinyl acetate 0.344 2.91 1.15\\n\\nAll-trans retinyl palmitate 0.549 1.82 1.83\\n\\nAll-trans beta-carotene3 1.800 0.56 6.00\\n\\nMixed carotenoids4 3.600 0.28 12.00\\n\\n1.

Provitamin A carotenoids other than beta-carotene.\\n\\nFunctions\\n\\nVitamin A has a number of different functions in the body. In recent years, knowledge of the\\nfunctions of vitamin A has increased greatly. The Sight and Life Manual on Vitamin A Deficiency\\nDisorders has updated the information about the major functions of vitamin A.\\n\\n\\n\\n9090909090 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIt is necessary for normal growth and development. If the intake of vitamin A is not sufficient for\\nnormal growth, the bones will stop growing, before the soft tissues are affected. This may result in\\novercrowding of the brain and nervous system, cranial pressure and consequent brain and nerve injury.\\nIn some instances the pressure on the optic nerve may result in blindness. Vitamin A deficiency may\\nsometimes cause degeneration of nervous tissue without causing bone malformation.\\n\\nFunction in Vision: Vitamin A occurs in the retina of the eye and is required in the process of\\nvision to adjust to light of varying intensity (dark adaptation). It occurs in the light receptor cells in the\\nretina in combination with protein. This substance is known as visual purple (rhodopsin). It is bleached\\nin the presence of light, which enables a person to see. Some vitamin A is used up in the process. If\\nmore vitamin A is not available, ability to adjust to changes in intensity of light is impaired. Night\\nblindness occurs in severe vitamin A deficiency; it indicates the inability of a person to see at night,\\nwhen the amount of light is far too little to permit adequate vision.\\n\\nFigure 8.1: Current model of the visual cycle (Ranalo 1994).\\n\\n(Sight & Life Manual of VADD, p. 32, 2001)\\n\\nThe current model of the visual cycle is given in Figure 8.1.\\nHealth of Epithelial Tissues: These tissues cover the outer surface of the body, line the major\\n\\ncavities and all the tubular systems in the body. These are specialised tissues, of which the outer\\ncovering is resistant; protective epidermis and the internal tissue is a secretory mucous membrane.\\nInadequate supplies of vitamin A results in suppression of the normal secretions and produces a keratinised\\n(dry, horny) type of epithelium. The skin may become excessively dry and mucous membrane may fail\\nto secrete normally and hence be prone to bacterial invasion.\\n\\nIn vitamin A deficiency keratin-producing cells replace mucus-secreting cells in many epithelial\\ntissues of the body. This is the basis of the pathological process termed xerosis that leads to the drying\\nof the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye. The process can be reversed by vitamin A. It has become\\nclear recently that vitamin A mainly in the form of retinoic acid plays a key hormone-like role in cell\\ndifferentiation throughout the tissue and organs of the body. Hence the formation of retinoic acid must\\nbe regulated precisely.\\n\\n\\n\\nFat-soluble Vitamins 9191919191\\n\\nImmune Response: Many of the epithelial tissues are important barriers to infection. Vitamin A\\ndeficiency impairs this function in a non-specific way. In addition, vitamin A in a more specific way\\nhelps to maintain the lymphocyte pool. Vitamin A also functions in T-cell-mediated responses. Some\\naspects of the immune response, such as immunoglobulin production, are now known to be affected\\nby retinoids.\\n\\nHaemopoesis: Vitamin A deficiency in man and experimental animals is consistently associated\\nwith an iron deficiency type of anaemia. In these conditions, vitamin A is required in addition to iron for\\na full response.\\n\\nGrowth: Retinoic acid is known to play its hormone-like function in control of growth and\\ndevelopment of tissues in the musculo-skeletal system, just as it does elsewhere.\\n\\nOther Functions\\n\\nEnergy Balance: It has been recently shown that an enzyme in mitochondria, which controls the\\nlocal production of energy as heat is under the transcriptional regulation of retinoic acid.\\n\\nCentral Nervous System: Retinoic acid plays a major role in the development of the foetal\\ncentral nervous system.\\n\\nGap Junctional Communication: Gap junctions are narrow, hydrophilic pores connecting the\\ncytosol of two adjacent cells. The gap junctions are reported to be involved in regulation of morphogenesis,\\ncell differentiation, secretion of hormones and growth. Retinoic acid and its analogues act as ligands of\\nnuclear receptors.\\n\\nActivity of Carotenoids: Carotenoids carry out several important functions in animals and plants.\\nSome carotenoids are only precursors of vitamin A and its derivatives. They act as accessory pigments\\nin energy transfer in photosynthesis. Carotenoids have a photoprotective role in man and bacteria.\\nThey are also involved in phototropism in simple and higher plant forms and in plant growth regulation.\\nCarotenoids act in the trapping or tying up of single oxygen. They are used as colouration of food for\\nmankind.\\n\\nFood Sources\\nVitamin A is present in animal foods only. Liver is the richest source of vitamin A. Other sources\\n\\ninclude butter, ghee, milk, curds and egg yolk. Refined oils and vanaspati are good sources of vitamin\\nA if these are fortified with vitamin A. These may be fortified with vitamin A to the extent of 750 mcg\\n(2500 IU) per 100 g. Table 8.2 lists the important food sources of vitamin A (Figure 8.2).\\n\\nVitamin A is not present in vegetable foods, but these foods contain the pigment, beta-carotene,\\nwhich is the precursor of vitamin A and is therefore also known as ‘provitamin A’. On the basis of its\\nchemical structure one molecule of beta-carotene should be able to yield two molecules of vitamin A.\\nIn the body, however, the absorption and conversion of beta-carotene is not that perfect and may range\\nfrom 25 to 50 per cent (Please refer to formulae at the end of the chapter)\\n\\nLeafy vegetables such as spinach, amaranth, coriander, and drumstick leaves as well as ripe fruits\\nsuch as mango, papaya, and yellow pumpkin are good sources of beta-carotene. Generally, dark green\\nleafy vegetables contain greater amounts of carotene than those which are light in colour (Table 8.2).\\n\\nLycopene, a carotenoid from tomatoes, is an antioxidant. It has the ability to protect against\\nvascular degeneration, the leading cause of adult blindness. Algal carotenoids lutin and zeaxanthin have\\nthe same ability and are used as food additives. Lycopene is known to inhibit carcinogenesis in specific\\nanimal systems and is expected to have similar protective effects in humans. Lycopene supplementation\\ncan reduce prostrate cancer risk by approximately 45 per cent.\\n\\n\\n\\n9292929292 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFood\\n\\nFigure 8.2: Food sources of vitamin A.\\n\\n*  includes beta-carotene\\n**  Only beta-carotene present\\n\\n***  RDA: Recommended Daily Allowances (of vit. A)\\n\\nLarge intake of vitamin A in times of plenty are stored in the liver and help the body to tide over\\nperiods of shortage. Similarly an occasional intake of a concentrated source also helps to meet the\\nrequirements for this vitamin.\\n\\nTable 8.2: Sources of Vitamin A\\n\\nVitamin A value\\n\\nVitamin A Carotene\\nmcg/100 g mcg/100 g\\n\\nLiver, sheep 6,690 –\\n\\nEggs 360 600\\n\\nButter, ghee (cow’s) 600–960 –\\n\\nMilk 48–52 6\\n\\nLeaves:\\n\\nDark green, e.g., amaranth, radish, spinach – 5000 or more\\n\\nLight green-cabbage, lettuce – 750–2000\\n\\nYellow or orange, vegetables and fruits, – 665–2740\\ne.g., carrots, mango, papaya, orange\\n\\nImmature beans and peas, capsicum, tomato – 80–595\\n\\nLiver oils of shark, halibut, cod and saw fish are some of the richest known sources1 of vitamin\\nA. However fish liver oils do not form part of the diet and have to be taken as a supplement.\\n1. Fish liver oils contain preformed vitamin A, the contents per one gramme being 200 to 700 mcg in cod liver\\noil, about 700 mcg in shark liver oil and 10,000 mcg in halibut liver oil.\\n\\n\\n\\nFat-soluble Vitamins 9393939393\\n\\nHuman Requirements\\n\\nIt is customary to express requirements for vitamin A for humans in terms of Retinol Equivalents\\n(RE/day) taking into account the many different activities of retinol and the provitamin carotenoids.\\nTable 8.3 gives RDIs for vitamin A from several different agencies. These were meant to prevent\\ndeficiency and provide a margin of safety.\\n\\nHowever recent evidence has emerged to show the protective effects of increased amounts of\\nantioxidant nutrients such as carotenoids against chronic diseases. Since these beneficial effects were\\nnot thought of in forming the recommendations, it is usual to advise increase in the intake of fresh\\nvegetables and fruits.\\n\\nTable 8.3: Recommended Dietary Intake of Vitamin A (mcg/day)*\\n\\nASG** FAO/WHO USA UK\\n\\n0–1 350 375 350\\n\\n1–3 400 400 400\\n\\n4–6 400 500 500\\n\\n7–12 years 400 700 500\\n\\n10–12 years 500 700 500\\n\\n12–15 years 600 700 600\\n\\nM 15–18 + years 600 1000 700\\n\\nF 15–18 + years 500 800 600\\n\\nPregnancy 600 800 +100\\n\\nLactation 850 (I half) 1300 +350\\n(II half) 1200\\n\\n* McLaren, D.S. & M.

The\\nallowance for infants is 350 mcg (about 1400 mcg of beta carotene). The need increases gradually as\\nthe child grows to adolescence. No increased allowance during pregnancy is recommended but the\\nallowance is increased to 950 mcg or 3800 mcg of beta-carotene during lactation. This is in conformity\\nwith the FAO/WHO recommendations.\\n\\nEffect of Deficiency\\n\\nThe deficiency may result from dietary lack of vitamin A, the provitamin, or poor absorption of\\nthese. The deficiency results in growth failure, affects the vision, the skin and the immune function\\nadversely.\\n\\nThe earliest symptom is impaired ability to see in dim light (dark adaptation); the next stage is\\ninability to see normally in dim light which is known as night blindness or nyctalopia.\\n\\nThe next symptom is usually dryness of lining of eyelids and eyeball (conjunctiva). A later and\\nmore severe stage of deficiency is xerosis (dryness) of the cornea. The cornea becomes dry and loses\\nits transparency (xerophthalmia). In the last stage of the disease, keratomalacia, the cornea becomes\\nsoft and results in permanent blindness.\\n\\nIn early stages, treatment with vitamin A will restore full vision; however, if advanced changes\\nhave taken place,  blindness is inevitable. The term xerophthalmia refers to clinical manifestation of\\nvitamin A deficiency. The skin changes include dryness, wrinkling, slate gray discolouration and\\nthickening of the outer layer (hyperkeratosis). The hair may lose lustre.\\n\\nThere is a noticeable shrinking, hardening and progressive degeneration of epithelial cells, which\\nincreases susceptibility to severe infections of the eye, the nasal passages, the sinuses, middle ear,\\nlungs and genitourinary tract.\\n\\nOverdosage\\nAn overdosage of vitamin A  may cause serious injury to health. Self-administration of highly\\n\\npotent concentrates is likely to cause a serious condition from which recovery is slow. Some of the\\nsymptoms of overdosage are irritability, headache, nausea and vomiting. Symptoms subside gradually\\non stoppage of intake of vitamin A.\\n\\nVitamin D\\n\\nPure vitamin D was isolated in crystalline form in 1930 and was called calciferol. Vitamin D is\\nnow considered a pro-hormone than a vitamin. Vitamin D is sometimes called the ‘sunshine vitamin’\\nbecause the body is able to convert a precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol, a sterol present in the skin, to\\nvitamin D in the presence of sunlight. It can be synthesised in the body in adequate amounts by simple\\nexposure to sunlight even for five minutes per day.\\n\\nVitamin D activity is shown by a group of chemical substances called sterols, which are wax like\\nsubstances. These compounds are insoluble in water, but are soluble in fats. They are stable to heat,\\nacids, alkalies and oxidation.\\n\\nFunctions\\n\\nVitamin D performs several important functions in the body. These include:\\n\\n\\n\\nFat-soluble Vitamins 9595959595\\n\\n• Absorption of calcium and phosphorus: calcitriol, a hormone, is an activated form of vitamin\\nD. It acts with two other hormones (the parathyroid hormone and the thyroid hormone\\ncalcitonin) and stimulates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus in the small intestine.\\nWithout the presence of vitamin D formation of strong and rigid bones is not possible.\\n\\n• Bone mineralisation: The bone tissue formation from calcium and phosphorus and other\\nmaterials is regulated by calcitriol. It regulates the rate of deposit and resorption of these\\nmainerals in bone. This balancing process helps to build and maintain bone tissue. Vitamin D\\nhormone can be used to treat rickets in children and osteoporosis (bone loss) in older women.\\n\\nFood Sources\\n\\nIrradiation of the skin with sunlight is the main source of vitamin D. The mid-day sun is rich in\\nultra-violet light and helps in synthesising this vitamin.\\n\\nFoods are not a good source of vitamin D. It is found in small quantities in liver, egg yolk, milk\\nand milk fat (butter and ghee), obtained form animals fed on pastures exposed to sunlight.\\n\\nThe richest source known is fish liver oils, such as halibut, cod, shark and sawfish. Fish liver oils\\ndo not form part of the diet and have to be taken as a supplement.\\n\\nVanaspati may be fortified with 180 International units of vitamin D per 100 g. The per capita\\nconsumption of vanaspati is quite low in India and so the impact of this fortification is limited.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowance\\nIt is difficult to set requirements for this nutrient due to its unique hormonelike nature, its synthesis\\n\\nin the skin by sun’s irradiation of the 7-dehydrocholesterol there and its limited food sources. As the\\nextent of synthesis of this vitamin and dietary intake is not easy to determine, exact data on vitamin D\\nrequirement is not available. Only a range of values is usually given. About 5 mcg or 200 International\\nUnits1 are stated to be the daily requirement of a child. The requirements for adults may be less but are\\nnot known with any degree of certainty. However, during pregnancy, adequate supply of vitamin D is\\nessential for the healthy development of the foetus.\\n\\nAs already said, exposure to sunlight results in the conversion of a compound present in the skin\\nto vitamin D. Thus a specific recommendation of a daily supplement of 10 mcg or 400 IU per day is\\nmade for only people who work at night, those whose habits or style of dress shield them from sunlight\\nand for invalids who stay indoors.\\n\\nEffect of Deficiency\\nWhen adequate quantities of vitamin D are not available, strong and rigid bones are not formed.\\n\\nThis leads to a condition in children known as ‘rickets’ which is characterised by poor growth and\\nbone deformation such as bowed legs, beaded ribs, enlarged joints and skull deformation. The teeth of\\nchildren may fail to develop normally because of poor calcification and may have pits and cracks\\nwhich render them prone to decay. In young girls, improper formation of the bones of the pelvis may\\nresult in difficult deliveries of babies, later on in their life.\\n\\nOsteomalacia—a condition similar to rickets may develop in adult women due to lack of vitamin\\nD. This deficiency disease is common in north India and Pakistan especially among women who have\\nhad many pregnancies and have nursed their children for long periods. The bones may become so\\nweak that they may not bear the weight of their bodies and may bend or break.\\n\\n1.  One International unit (I.U.) = 0.025 mcg of vitamin D.\\n\\n\\n\\n9696969696 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nOverdosage\\n\\nIntake of excessive amounts of vitamin D is toxic to the body and causes irritability, nausea,\\nvomitting and constipation. Even a dose of 1000 International Units (25 mcg), when administered over\\nlong periods of time, has been found to cause toxic side effects in children.\\n\\nVitamine E\\n\\nVitamin E or alpha-tocopherol is a fat-soluble vitamin.\\nNo definite proof of vitamin E deficiency in human beings has been established.\\n\\nFunctions\\n\\nThe main function of vitamin E, tocopherol, is its ability to prevent tissue breakdown, by virtue of\\nits antioxidant nature.\\n\\nVitamin E acts as nature’s most powerful fat-soluble antioxidant. In the lipid membranes of body\\ntissues, the polyunsaturated fatty acids present are easy targets for oxygen to break down. Vitamin E\\nprotects the cell membrane fatty acids from damage by interrupting this oxidation process. It is believed\\nto prevent the oxidation of vitamin A and carotene in the digestive tract and to regulate the rate of\\noxidation of foods inside the body.\\n\\nSelenium is a trace mineral that works as a partner with vitamin E as an anti-oxidant.\\nThere is a paucity of Indian data both on the vitamin E (tocopherol) content of foods and on\\n\\nvitamin E status. Limited information suggests that Indians have blood levels of 0.5 mg/kg/ml which is\\nconsidered as satisfactory.\\n\\nFood Sources\\nThe richest sources of vitamin E are the vegetable oils. Vegetable oils are also the richest sources\\n\\nof polyunsaturated fatty acids, which vitamin E protects. This is nature’s unique arrangement to package\\nthe two together. Other food sources include cereals, leafy vegetables, milk, eggs, muscle meats and\\nfish.\\n\\nVitamin E is widely distributed in foods. Even the cheapest kind of cereal diet contains sufficient\\nintake of the vitamin.\\n\\nVitamin E requirement is linked to that of essential fatty acids (linoleic and linolenic acids). The\\nrequirement of vitamin E suggesed is 0.8 mg/g of essential fatty acids.\\n\\nVitamin K: Phylloquinone is the major form of vitamin K found in plants. It is also the form\\nfound in our dietary.\\n\\nThe basic function of vitamin K is in the blood-clotting process. It is essential for the formation\\nof prothrombin by the liver. Prothrombin is a normal constituent of the blood and helps clotting of\\nblood on contact with air.\\n\\nGreen leafy vegetables are the principal dietary source of vitamin K. Deficiency of vitamin K\\nprolongs clotting time and may result in excessive bleeding after an injury. Human babies do not have\\nreserves of vitamin K at birth and in many hospital it is, therefore, routine practice to give vitamin K to\\nthe expectant mother to prevent excessive bleeding at child  birth.\\n\\n\\n\\nFat-soluble Vitamins 9797979797\\n\\nThe normal formation of vitamin in the intestinal tract is disturbed by the use of sulfa drugs.\\nPatients, who are treated with antibiotics, after surgery, are likely to suffer from vitamin K deficiency,\\ndue to killing of intestinal bacteria, which synthesise the vitamin. Thus there may be blood loss due to\\nnon-clotting and poor wound healing.\\n\\nThe Indian RDA committee considered that no recommendation need be made for vitamin K,\\nsince  Vitamin K deficiency is seen in India only occasionally in premature newborn infants. It is\\nsuggested that a dose of 0.5–1.0 mg of vitamin K be administered by the intramuscular route to such\\ninfants.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. List the fat soluble vitamins and their precursors.

These include ascorbic\\nacid and the B-complex vitamins. The water-soluble vitamins are absorbed quickly in the body and the\\namounts not utilised are excreted in the urine. Adequate amounts should, therefore, be supplied in the\\ndaily diet. Some of the water-soluble vitamins are partly lost in cooking procedures. This factor has to\\nbe kept in mind while meeting their requirements.\\n\\nVitamin B-Complex\\n\\nA number of substances have been identified and grouped together under this heading. It must be\\nnoted that each of the B vitamins is a separate vitamin in name, structure and function.\\n\\nSix members of this group, namely, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid and vitamin\\nB12 are included in the RDA, because definite requirements of these vitamins have been established\\nthrough research. A diet, which provides adequate amount of these six vitamins, also, carries enough\\nof the other members of this group. All these vitamins are essential for human nutrition. The structural\\nformulae of the B-complex vitamins and vitamin C are given at the end of the chapter.\\n\\nThiamin\\n\\nThiamin (also known as vitamin B1 and aneurin) was first isolated in 1926 from rice polishings by\\nJansen and Donath. They isolated 100 mg of crystals from 100 kg of rice polishings. Subsequently, it\\nwas synthesised in 1936 by R.R. Williams and is now available in the market in the form of thiamin\\nhydrochloride.\\n\\nThe name thiamin is derived from its chemical ringlike structure. Thiamin consists of substituted\\npyrimidine and thiazole rings linked by a methylene bridge. It exists mainly in various inter-convertible\\nphosphorylated forms, chiefly thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). It is very soluble in water and is readily\\nbroken down by heat in neutral or alkaline solutions.\\n\\nFunctions: The basic function of thiamin as a coenzyme is related to release of energy from\\nglucose and its storage as fat, thus it makes energy available for normal growth and function of the\\nbody. Thiamin pyrophosphate, the coenzyme form of thiamin, is necessary for catalysing the oxidation\\nof carbohydrates in the body. This reaction releases energy in the system.\\n\\nThiamin is needed to maintain normal function of three systems in the body, gastrointestinal,\\nnervous and cardiovascular system.\\n\\nGastrointestinal System: Thiamin helps to produce energy needed for the cells of smooth\\nmuscles and secretory glands. In its lack, there is lack of muscle tone and deficient gastric secretions;\\nas a result there is poor appetite, indigestion, constipation and poor stomach function.\\n\\nNervous System: The central nervous system needs glucose as energy source for its function.\\nWhen there is a lack of thiamin, the energy is not released and nerves are unable to work, with loss of\\nresponse and alertness. The result is apathy, fatigue and irritability. If the deficit continues, nerve\\ntissues may be damaged causing pain and finally paralysis.\\n\\nCardiovascular System: If energy supply is not continuous, due to lack of thiamin, the heart\\nmuscle weakens and may lead to heart failure. The blood vessel walls become weak, the vessels may\\ndilate and fluid may accumulate in the lower part of legs.\\n\\nThus insufficient thiamin supply affects the body systems adversely and body function is disturbed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWater-soluble Vitamins 101101101101101\\n\\nFood\\n\\nFood Sources: Nearly all foods, except sugars, fats and oils, contain some thiamin. Plant sources\\ninclude pulses, nuts, oilseeds and whole grain cereals. Parboiled rice and fresh peas are good sources\\nof thiamin. Leafy green vegetables and animal foods such as milk, eggs, fish and meat are fair sources.\\n\\nMost foods, however, contain only small quantities and it is necessary to consume a variety of\\nfoods to fulfil the daily thiamin needs. Table 9.1 gives the thiamin content of some common foods\\n(Figure 9.1).\\n\\nThe main source of thiamin in the Indian dietary is cereals but refining of cereals reduces thiamin\\ncontent with most of the thiamin being lost in the polishing. Chapatis made form whole wheat flour,\\nwhen eaten as a staple, provide 50 per cent of the day’s thiamin needs. The dal eaten with it, provides\\n25 per cent of the thiamin needed. Seventy-five per cent of the thiamin is lost when wheat flour is\\nrefined to manufacture maida. Parboiling of rice helps to conserve thiamin. Thiamin being water-\\nsoluble is also lost, when water in which cereals or pulses are cooked is discarded. Long cooking also\\ndestroys some thiamin.\\n\\nUnder ordinary conditions of cooking, most of the thiamin losses occur due to solution and not\\nbecause of heat-inactivation. If cooking water is not discarded, most of the thiamin (85–95 per cent) is\\nretained.\\n\\nRecommended Daily Allowance\\n\\nAs thiamin is directly involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism, the thiamin requirement is\\nexpressed in terms of energy intake. Hence the recommended thiamin allowance is 0.5 mg per 1000\\ncalories for all age groups.\\n\\nTable 9.1: Sources of Thiamin\\n\\nThiamin\\n\\nmg/100 mg/unit*\\n\\nPulses, oilseeds and nuts (except coconut) 0.24–1.00 0.06–0.25\\n\\nCereals\\nWhole 0.20–0.98 0.05–0.24\\nRefined 0.06–0.12 0.01–0.03\\n\\nFlesh Foods\\nPork 0.54 0.27\\nLiver, sheep 0.36 0.18\\nOther flesh foods, fish, eggs 0.03–0.18 0.01–0.09\\n\\nVegetables and Fruits\\nFresh peas, beans, capsicum and seetaphal 0.25–0.55 0.12–0.27\\nAll other vegetables and fruits 0.01–0.25 0.01–0.12\\n\\nMilk 0.05 0.07\\n\\n* One unit: Amount as indicated in the Daily Food Guide (Table 14.1).\\n\\n\\n\\n102102102102102 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 9.1: Food sources of thiamin.\\n\\nTable 9.2: RDAs of Thiamin, Riboflavin & Nicotinic Acid*\\n\\nThiamin 0.5 mg/1000 kcal\\n\\nRiboflavin 0.6 mg/1000 kcal\\n\\nNicotinic acid (Niacin equivalents)** 6.6 mg/1000 kcal\\n\\n* Nutrient Requirements & RDAs  for Indians, ICMR, 1990.\\n\\n** Niacin equivalents = Niacin mg +\\n60\\n\\nmg Tryptophan\\n\\nThere are very few studies of thiamin requirements of pregnant and nursing mothers and none on\\nthe requirement of children. Hence RDA is fixed at 0.5 mg per 1000 kcal and the total intake is related\\nto their energy allowance.\\n\\nThe method used to determine the RDA for thiamin combines erythrocyte transketolase activity,\\nurinary excretion and other findings. The RDA for thiamin is given in Table 9.2.\\n\\nStability: Most of the thiamin is in the aleurone layer of the cereal grain. Using whole grain flours\\nto make chapatis, rotis, ensures retention of thiamin. Thiamin is water soluble and cooking water\\nshould be retained in the recipe made to prevent loss. It is fairly stable, but is destroyed by alkalis and\\nprolonged heat. Cooking the food to just done stage and avoiding use of soda in preparation, helps to\\nretain most of the thiamin in the preparation.\\n\\n\\n\\nWater-soluble Vitamins 103103103103103\\n\\nEffect of Deficiency : When thiamin intake is deficient, the digestive system is disturbed resulting\\nin loss of appetite (anorexia), poorly toned muscles and constipation. Loss of appetite may be\\naccompanied by nausea and vomitting.\\n\\nThiamin deficiency can also affect the nervous system. Some of the symptoms observed are\\nmental depression, moodinesss, irritability, forgetfulness, confusion and fear. Severe deficiency leads\\nto beri-beri, a disease of the nervous system, which has been known since antiquity. The name ‘beri\\nberi’ is a Singhalese word meaning ‘I can’t I can’t’, which describes the disease, as the person is\\nalways too ill to do anything.\\n\\nThiamin deficiency is found in association with chronic alcoholism, due to very low food intake\\nand increased demand. Intake of thiamin restores normalcy.\\n\\nRiboflavin\\n\\nRiboflavin, a more heat-stable factor, was discovered after thiamin. It was isolated from yeast by\\nWarburg and Christian. Kuhn and coworkers synthesised it in 1935. It was formerly known as vitamin\\nB2 or vitamin G. The name riboflavin is derived from its chemical structure. It is a yellow-green (Latin\\nword ‘flavus’ means yellow) fluorescent pigment containing the sugar ‘ribose’, hence the name riboflavin.\\n\\nIt is less soluble in water than thiamin and more stable to heat, especially in acid solutions. When\\nin solution, riboflavin is destroyed on exposure to sunlight.\\n\\nFor example, prolonged exposure of milk to direct sunlight may decrease the riboflavin content of\\nmilk considerably.\\n\\nFunctions: The primary form of riboflavin is as an integral part of the coenzymes flavin\\nmononucleotide (FMN) and flavin-adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Riboflavin functions as a vital part of\\ncoenzymes in both energy production and tissue protein building.\\n\\nIt is thus essential for tissue health and growth of all animal and plant life (including\\nmicroorganisms). It plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of mucocutaneous structures.\\n\\nFood Sources: Milk is a rich source of riboflavin. So also are products derived from milk such as\\nyoghurt (curds), butter milk, milk powder and concentrated milk (Table 9.3). There is no riboflavin in\\nbutter and ghee because the vitamin is water-soluble and remains in the water extract during the\\nremoval of butter from milk or curds.\\n\\nLiver and kidney of animals and birds are also good sources of riboflavin. Pulses, green leafy\\nvegetables, eggs, and meat contain a fair amount (Figure 9.2). Cereals, roots and fruits are poor\\nsources of riboflavin.\\n\\nRecommended Daily Allowance\\n\\nThe requirements of riboflavin have been determined by recording urinary excretion and the\\nconcentration of the vitamin in blood cells. In addition, riboflavin requirement is indicated by the\\nintakes of riboflavin necessary to maintain saturated levels of the enzyme glutathione reductase in\\nerythrocytes (EGR) (riboflavin is a co-factor of this enzyme).\\n\\nRiboflavin requirement is related to total energy requirements. For practical purposes the general\\nRDA standard is based on 0.60 mg of riboflavin per 1000 kcal for all ages. Thus the recommended\\nallowance varies from 0.7mg for an infant to 1.7 mg for an adolescent.\\n\\nThe need for riboflavin increases during pregnancy and lactation and also with increased activity\\nand caloric intake. The disease conditions, in which increased riboflavin in the diet is called for include,\\n\\n\\n\\n104104104104104 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFood\\n\\nrecovery from wasting diseases, convalescence (for rebuilding of tissues), diarrhoea and vomitting (to\\nmake up for poor absorption).\\n\\nTable 9.3: Sources of Riboflavin\\n\\nRiboflavin\\n\\nmg/100 g mg/unit*\\n\\nBael fruit 1.19 0.60\\n\\nLiver, sheep 1.70 0.85\\n\\nDark green leafy vegetables 0.30–0.47 0.15–0.23\\n\\nMilk 0.10–0.19 0.15–0.30\\n\\nPulses, whole and split 0.15–0.39 0.04–0.10\\n\\nNuts 0.19–0.97 0.05–0.24\\n\\nOther flesh foods and eggs 0.09–0.44 0.04–0.22\\n\\nCereals and their products 0.03–0.29 <0.01–0.07\\n\\n* One Unit: Amount as indicated in the Daily Food Guide (Table 14.1).\\n\\nFigure 9.2: Food sources of riboflavin.\\n\\n\\n\\nWater-soluble Vitamins 105105105105105\\n\\nEffect of Deficiency: Lack of riboflavin affects the eyes, skin and nerves. The eyelids become\\nrough and the eye becomes sensitive to bright sunlight. This condition is called photophobia (fear of\\nlight). The skin changes are found around the area of the mouth, on the lips, tongue and nose. The lips\\nbecome inflamed, cracks are observed at the corners of the mouth and the tongue is swollen, red and\\nsore. These are clinically known as cheilosis, angular stomatitis, naso-labial dyssebacia and scrotal\\ndermititis. The deficiency symptoms can be corrected by administering riboflavin.\\n\\nNiacin\\n\\nGoldberger in 1915 observed the existence of a pellagra-preventing factor, which he related to B\\nvitamins. He found that the same factor cured black tongue in dogs. In 1937 Elvehjem and coworkers\\ndiscovered that nicotinic acid was effective in curing black tongue in dogs. Smith and others found that\\nnicotinic acid cured pellagra in humans. Thus a known substance (nicotinic acid) was identified as a\\nvitamin. Cowgill suggested that the term ‘niacin’ be used for nicotinic acid to avoid association with\\nthe nicotine of tobacco.\\n\\nNiacin, the term which includes both nicotinic acid and nicotinamide, is another vitamin of the\\nB-complex group. The amide is very soluble in water and is the one preferred therapeutically because\\nit has no side reactions. Both products are stable and are not affected by heat, acid or alkali.\\n\\nFunctions: Niacin functions in the body as a component of two important co-enzymes NAD and\\nNADP. The full name is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and its phosphate derivative respectively.\\nThese coenzymes are involved in tissue respiration and synthesis and the breakdown of glucose to\\nproduce energy. Niacin works in close association with riboflavin and thiamin in the cell metabolism\\nsystem that produces energy. It is necessary for growth.\\n\\nRequirements: All the factors, which affect energy needs, influence niacin requirement. Since\\none of the amino acids, tryptophan has been shown to be a precursor of niacin in the body, the total\\nniacin requirement is stated in terms of ‘niacin equivalents’ to account for both sources. About 60 mg\\nof tryptophan can give rise to one mg of niacin.\\n\\nTable 9.4 indicates the niacin equivalents in foods.\\nNiacin equivalents are calculated as follows:\\n\\nNiacin equivalents mg = Niacin content in mg + 60\\nmgin content  Tryptophan\\n\\nSouces: In plant foods, groundnuts are the best source of niacin. Liver, an organ meat, is a rich\\nsource of niacin (Table 9.5).  But both groundnuts and liver are included in the diet occasionally.\\nTherefore cereals, which are used as staples, are the major source of niacin in the Indian diet, and they\\nare supplemented by pulses and meat. Unrefined and parboiled cereals retain more niacin than refined\\nones.\\n\\nMilk, eggs, vegetables and fruits contain very small amounts of niacin. Brewer’s yeast is a very\\nconcentrated source of niacin. It is sometimes added to recipes to increase niacin content of the diet.\\nFigure 9.3 depicts the food sources of niacin.\\n\\n\\n\\n106106106106106 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFood\\n\\nFood\\n\\nTable 9.4: Niacin Equivalents in Foods1,2 in 100 g Edible Portion\\n\\nNiacin Tryptophan Niacin\\n(a) (b) equivalents\\n\\n(mg) (mg) (in mg)\\n\\nCereals\\nRice, raw, milled 1.9 87 3.3\\nRico, parboiled, milled 3.8 71 5.0\\nWheat, whole, flour 4.3 133 6.5\\nBajra 2.3 204 5.7\\nJowar (sorghum. vulgare) 3.1 116 5.0\\nPulses\\nArhar or tur dal 2.9 143 5.3\\nBlackgram 2.0 269 6.5\\nGreen gram whole 2.1 230 5.9\\nLentil 2.6 241 6.6\\nBengal gram, whole 2.9 137 5.2\\nGroundnuts 19.9 243 23.9\\nVegetables\\nAmaranth, tender 0.4 45 1.1\\nPotato 1.2 26 1.6\\nMilk 0.1 62 1.1\\nEgg 0.1 192 3.3\\nPomfrets 2.6 196 5.8\\n\\n1.

The figure recommended is 6.6 mg per 1000 calories. The total niacin\\nequivalent required daily on the basis of calorie requirement could range from 8 mg to 26 mg depending\\non the age and occupation of the individual (Table 9.2).\\n\\nEffect of Deficiency: Lack of niacin affects the skin, gastrointestinal tract and nervous system.\\nThe skin, especially the part exposed to the sun, itches and burns. Lack of appetite in early stages is\\nfollowed by diarrhoea in later states. Nervous changes include dizziness, insomnia, irritability, fear,\\ndepression and forgetfulness; later on there may be dementia. The deficiency disease is known as\\npellagra which is seen in endemic form in some parts of India, where jowar (sorghum) is the staple\\nfood. Deficiency symptoms can be corrected by administering niacin.\\n\\nPyridoxine\\n\\nThree naturally occurring pyridine derivatives (pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine) are known\\nas vitamin B6.\\n\\nFunctions: Vitamin B6 is a co-factor for several enzymes connected with the metabolism of\\namino acids. It is also believed to have a role in the formation of antibodies.\\n\\nSources: Data on the vitamin B6 contents of foods are limited. However, pulses, wheat and meat\\nare known to be rich sources, while other cereals are fair sources. Vegetables and fruits are relatively\\npoor sources.\\n\\nRequirements: There is some evidence that the pyridoxine requirements may be related to\\nprotein intake. The average requirement for adults would appear to be about 1.5 mg per day. Cooking\\nlosses in normal Indian diets are negligible; hence no allowances for losses need be made.\\n\\nThe suggested daily intake varies from 0.4 mg for infants to 2.0 mg for adults and 2.5 mg for\\nexpectant and nursing mothers (Table 9.6).\\n\\nDeficiency: The symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency—such as peripheral neuritis, anaemia, glossitis,\\ncheilosis and seborrhic dermatitis are similar to those of other B vitamins. Hence the extent of pyridoxine\\ndeficiency in India is not known.\\n\\n\\n\\n108108108108108 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n\\uf8fc\\n\\uf8fd\\n\\uf8fe\\n\\n0.9\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n2.0\\n\\n25 0.2 25\\n\\nTable 9.6: Suggested Daily Intake of Pyridoxine, Folate, Vitamin B12 and Ascorbic Acid\\n\\nPyridoxine Folate Vitamin B12 Ascorbic\\nmg gµ gµ acid mg\\n\\nAdult man and woman 2.0 100 1 40\\n\\nPregnant woman 2.5 400 1 40\\n\\nLactating woman 2.5 150 1.5 80\\n\\nInfant: 0–6 months 0.3\\n\\n6–12 months 0.4\\n\\nPreschool children 1–3 years 40\\n\\n4–6 years 50\\n\\nSchool children 7–9 years 60 0.2 to 1.0 40\\n\\n10–12 years 70\\n\\nAdolescents 13–15 years 100\\n\\n16–18 years 100\\n\\nFolic Acid\\n\\nFolic acid and related compounds, which is one of the B vitamins, was discovered in 1941, as a\\ngrowth factor for bacteria. It was found to be essential for all vertebrates including man. Its name was\\nderived from the Latin word folium, which means leaf, because it was first isolated from spinach\\nleaves and is widely distributed in green, leafy plants.\\n\\nFolic acid is pteroyl-mono-glutamic acid. It is quite soluble in slightly alkaline or acid solution; but\\nis reasonably stable in neutral or alkaline solutions, especially in the absence of air.\\n\\nFunctions: The primary function of folic acid is related to the transfer of single carbon in the\\nsynthesis of a number of metabolites in the body. It is also involved in  the synthesis of nucleic acid\\nalong with vitamin B12. Folic acid undergoes a series of metabolic conversions to its various coenzyme\\nforms after it is absorbed.\\n\\nSources: It is widely distributed in foods. Green leafy vegetables, liver, legumes and yeast are\\nrich sources of folic acid. It is a relatively stable vitamin but storage and cooking losses can be as high\\nas 50 per cent, especially if cooking water is discarded.\\n\\nSuggested Daily Intake: The safe level of folate intake would be 100 mcg per day for adults\\nand adolescents with 25 mcg in infancy increasing to 40 mcg at pre-school stage, gradually increasing\\nwith age to 100 mcg of folates at adolescence (Table 9.6).\\n\\nIt was observed in one study that the birth weights of infants, born to mothers who had taken 300\\nmcg folate per day during pregnancy, were higher than those born to mothers who had received 100 or\\n200 mcg daily. Hence the ICMR suggested intake in pregnancy is 300 mcg of additional folic acid daily.\\nThe additional needs may be met through folate supplements, as it may be difficult to provide it in the\\ndiet. Nursing mothers need additional 50 mcg of folic acid.\\n\\nDeficiency: Prolonged and severe folic acid deficiency leads to abnormal formation of red blood\\ncells resulting in megaloblastic anaemia. It responds to administration of folic acid.\\n\\n\\n\\nWater-soluble Vitamins 109109109109109\\n\\nVitamin B12\\n\\nVitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin was the last member of the B vitamins discovered in 1948. It\\ncontains cobalt and phosphorus and is red in colour. It is found only in animal foods and higher plants\\nare unable to synthesise it.\\n\\nCyanocobalamin is considered the most potent vitamin and is one of the last true vitamins that has\\nbeen classified. It was discovered through studies of pernicious anaemia, a condition that begins with\\na megaloblastic anaemia and leads to an irreversible degeneration of the central nervous system. It was\\nfound that the condition could be reversed by feeding afflicted patients large amounts of raw liver. The\\nactive material in the liver was found to be vitamin B12, which is present only in very small amount.\\nSuggested intakes are given in Table 9.6.\\n\\nCyanocobalamin contains a tetrapyrrole ring system, which is chemically very similar to the\\nporphyrin ring system of the haeme compounds.\\n\\nFunctions: It promotes normal growth and development. It helps with certain types of nerve\\ndamage, and treats pernicious anaemia. It is an essential component of several coenzymes, which are\\nneeded in the synthesis of nucleic acids. Its metabolism and use in the body is closely related to folic\\nacid. It is essential for the normal functioning of all cells, especially those of bone marrow, the nervous\\nsystem and the gastrointestinal tract.\\n\\nSources: The richest sources are liver, and organ meats. Milk, eggs, muscle meat and fish are\\ngood sources. Plant foods do not contain vitamin B12. It is not stable to heat and light; hence processed\\nfoods are not good sources. For example, there is 10 per cent loss in pasteurisation and 40 to 90 per\\ncent loss in evaporation of milk.\\n\\nDeficiency: Uncomplicated deficiency is characterised by symptoms such as sore tongue,\\nweakness, loss of weight, tingling of extremities, apathy, mental and other nervous abnormalities.\\nWhen there is a lack of intrinsic factor, essential for the absorption for the vitamin, pernicious anaemia\\nresults, in which there is degeneration of the spinal cord. There is a low level of vitamin B12 in the blood\\nand an inability of new RBCs to develop normally resulting in megaloblastic anaemia. The condition can\\nbe cured by injecting vitamin B12-intramuscularly.\\n\\nAscorbic Acid (Vitamin C)\\n\\nAscorbic acid (vitamin C) was isolated and its chemical structure elucidated in 1932 by C.G.\\nKing. Its lack in human diet has long been known to cause a disease called scurvy. In olden days,\\nsailors to whom fresh fruits and vegetables were not available for many days during long voyages at\\nsea developed this disease. It is reported that 100 out of the 180 men who sailed with Vasco da Gama,\\ndied of scurvy before they reached India in 1498.\\n\\nAscorbic acid closely resembles glucose in structure. The vitamin is a white, crystalline, odourless\\ncompound readily soluble in water. It is a strong reducing agent. It is comparatively stable in an acid\\nmedium but is destroyed by the action of heat, oxygen and catalysts such as copper.\\n\\nIt is now made synthetically and the synthetic product is relatively inexpensive.\\nFunctions: Ascorbic acid performs a number of important functions in the body. It is a part of\\n\\nthe cementing material which hold the body cells firmly in place. Thus it plays an important role to build\\nand maintain strong tissues in general, especially connective tissues (bone, cartilage, dentin, collagen,\\netc). Blood vessel tissue depends on vitamin C to form strong capillary walls.\\n\\n\\n\\n110110110110110 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nVitamin C is an important partner of protein for tissue synthesis. Naturally it is needed in growth\\nstages of life. High concentrations of vitamin C are found in metabolically active tissues in the body,\\nindicating its importance in their function. These include brain, liver, kidney, pancreas, adrenal glands,\\nthymus and spleen.\\n\\nIt helps the body to build resistance to infection. It helps in the absorption of calcium and ensures\\nthe health of bones. By aiding absorption of iron, it makes it available for haemoglobin synthesis. It is\\nneeded in wound healing, infections and fever to help recovery.\\n\\nBeing a strong reducing agent, it helps to tie up free radicals and thus protects the body from their\\ndeleterious effects.\\n\\nSources: Amla (nellikai, also called Indian gooseberry) is one of the richest sources of ascorbic\\nacid, which contains 600 mg/100 g of the fruit. Guavas and cashew apples contain 200 to 300 mg/\\n100 g. Citrus fruits such as oranges, sweet lime, grape-fruit and pomelo are also excellent sources of\\nascorbic acid. Drumsticks also have a high ascorbic acid content (Table 9.7).\\n\\nLeafy vegetables such as drumstick leaves, amaranth, cabbage, which are more frequently available,\\nare excellent sources of vitamin C (Figs. 9.4 & 9.5).\\n\\nSprouted pulses such as Bengal gram and green gram are good sources and have proved to be of\\nvalue during drought and famine conditions when other sources of ascorbic acid, such as fresh fruits\\nand vegetables are not available.\\n\\nStability: Vitamin C is a labile nutrient. It oxidises easily on exposure to air and heat. It is stable\\nin acid medium, so acid fruits (citrus) and vegetables (e.g., tomato) retain their vitamin C content. It is\\nsoluble in water and hence cooking water must be utilised to prevent loss. It is not stable in alkaline pH,\\nso soda should not be added in food preparation to prevent loss.\\n\\nTable 9.7: Sources of Vitamin C\\n\\nVit.

The recommended daily\\nallowance increases with age from 20 to 40 mg for children and is 40 mg per day for adult. An intake\\nof 80 mg per day is recommended for a nursing mother. The amount recommended is liberal, as\\nascorbic acid is a very labile nutrient (Table 9.6).\\n\\n\\n\\n112112112112112 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nDeficiency: If ascorbic acid is not present in sufficient quantity, the cementing material is not\\nformed in adequate amounts. Tiny breaks occur in the walls of very small blood vessels and haemorrhages\\nresult. The tissues of the gums become tender and often bleed. In severe cases, soft tissues around the\\njoints become swollen and are painful. There is general weakness, lack of appetite and thickened and\\nscaly skin. Spongy gums and haemorrhages in body tissues are other symptoms of scurvy; these can\\nbe reversed by including ascorbic acid rich foods in the diet.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

A liberal inake of calcium,\\nwith increased mobility and exposure to sunlight is known to improve the strength of bones and thus\\nreduce their fragility. A reduction in sodium intake can be one of the helpful factors in reducing\\nhypertension. Though advertisements for dietary supplements may lead you to  believe that these may\\nbe the answer to the problem, it is not so. The key is to select foods to meet the body's mineral needs\\nand to season foods moderately to avoid excess intake of salt.\\n\\nNature and Composition\\n\\nAs you may know from your elementary chemistry course, minerals are inorganic substances.\\nSo far we have studied nutrients, (carbohydrates, fats, proteins and vitamins), which are organic\\ncompounds.\\n\\nMinerals are present in all body tissues and fluids. In bones and teeth the minerals calcium and\\nphosphorus are deposited in protein material. Iron is found in blood as a part of the red pigment,\\nhaemoglobin. Minerals occur in foods as salts and also in combination with organic substances.\\n\\nMinerals have two distinct characteristics\\n• Mineral elements do not provide energy.\\n• Mineral elements are not destroyed during food preparation.\\n\\nThe mineral elements found in the body form only 4 to 6 per cent of the weight of our adult\\nbody. This means that about 2 to 3 kg of our body weight consists of minerals. Of this 90 per cent is\\naccounted for by seven minerals (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, sodium, chloride and\\nmagnesium). The other minerals are known as trace elements, as these add together to about 10 per\\ncent of the total mineral content of the body. The mineral composition of the adult body is given in\\nTable 10.1.\\n\\nThe largest concentration of minerals is found in the bones and teeth. Minerals are also found in\\nsoft tissues such as nerves and muscles and in blood and other body fluids.\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor and Trace Minerals 117117117117117\\n\\nMineral\\n\\nGeneral Functions of Minerals\\n\\nSome minerals play an important role in the regulation of body functions. These are:\\n1. Maintenance of acid-base balance.\\n2. Control of water balance.\\n3. Contraction of muscles.\\n4. Normal response of nerves to physiological stimulation.\\n5. Clotting of blood.\\n\\nMinerals do not act singly in their function and regulation of body processes, but work with the\\nhelp of other minerals and organic compounds. A certain concentration of each element must be\\npresent for efficient functioning of the body.\\n\\nTable 10.1: Mineral Composition of Adult Human Body1\\n\\nApproximate amount in adult body\\n\\n60 kg 50 kg\\nMajor Mineral Elements\\nCalcium 1030 g 855 g\\nPhosphorus 645 g 535 g\\nPotassium 210 g 175 g\\nSulfur 150 g 125 g\\nSodium 90 g 75 g\\nChlorine 90 g 75 g\\nMagnesium 26 g 21 g\\nTrace Elements\\nIron 3.4 g 2.9 g\\nMolybdenum 2.6 g 2.1 g\\nZinc 1.7 g 1.4 g\\nSelenium 1.7 g 1.4 g\\nFluorine 0.9 g 0.75 g\\nCopper 130 mg 110 mg\\nManganese 130 mg 110 mg\\nIodine 26 mg 21 mg\\nCobalt 4 mg 3.6 mg\\n\\nChromium 4 mg 3.6 mg\\n\\n1.  Based on Robinson et al., Basic Nutrition & Diet Therapy, 7th edn., p. 151, 1993.\\n\\nSome of the important tissue formations and processes in which mineral elements function in\\nunison are discussed below. This will be followed by a discussion of each important mineral element\\nand its specific functions.\\n\\n\\n\\n118118118118118 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nBones and Teeth Formation:  Most of the calcium, phosphorus and magnesium and small\\namounts of other mineral elements are deposited in the bones and teeth. Bones and teeth are formed of\\ntough protein material into which minerals are deposited. Most of the bone formation (ossification) in\\nthe foetus occurs in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy. At birth, the bones are very soft, but the\\ninfant has a well formed skeleton. Throughout the growth phases (childhood, adolescence and early\\nadulthood) the bones become long, thick and increase in hardness.\\n\\nThus bones form an important part of the body framework. Bones also serve as a reservoir of the\\ncomponent mineral elements. Thus the blood levels of these minerals are maintained by withdrawal of\\nthese elements from the bone. The minerals provided in the diet replace those withdrawn and thus help\\nto maintain the bone structure. Thus even in bones, there is a continuous process of maintenance and\\nrepair of the tissue.\\n\\nIn the foetus, the first teeth are formed from fourth to sixth week of pregnancy. By the twentieth\\nweek, these teeth calcify. These are milk teeth and their formation is known as primary dentition.\\n\\nSoon after birth up to about third birthday, the permanent teeth are formed, while wisdom teeth\\nare formed between the eighth and tenth year. Before the teeth erupt, they are fully formed. Tooth\\nenamel and dentine contain an appreciable quantities of calcium and phosphorus. These are protective\\nlayers of the teeth. As these parts do not contain blood vessels, a decayed tooth cannot repair itself.\\nHence the only way to ensure the health of teeth is to take care of the teeth and prevent decay.\\n\\nStructural Components of Soft Tissues: Many mineral elements are found in the structural\\ncomponents of soft tissues. These include potassium, sulphur, phosphorus, iron and others.\\n\\nAs Components and Co-factors of Vitamins, Hormones and Enzymes: Various regulatory\\ncompounds contain very small amounts of mineral elements as constituents. For example, sulphur is\\npart of many important compounds such as thiamin (a B vitamin) and coenzyme A. Vitamin B12 contains\\ncobalt; the enzyme carbonic anhydrase contains zinc and the hormone thyroxine contains iodine. Calcium,\\nas an activator, is a co-factor in the action of pancreatic lipase. Incorporation of iron into haemoglobin\\nneeds copper, while the synthesis of insulin in the pancreas needs zinc.\\n\\nMuscle Contraction and Response of Nerves are regulated by the mineral elements (sodium,\\npotassium, calcium and magnesium), present in body fluids in definite amounts. These elements regulate\\nthe movement of materials through the cell membrane. Normal response of nerves to physiological\\nstimuli are also regulated by these mineral elements.\\n\\nControl of Water Balance: Sodium and potassium are responsible for the control of water\\nbalance between the inside and outside of cells. This function is dependent on the correct concentrations\\nof sodium and potassium. Potassium is mainly found in the fluid inside the cell, while sodium is chiefly\\nfound in the fluid outside the cell.\\n\\nMaintenance of Acid-Base Balance: It is very important to maintain a constant pH in the body\\nfluids at all times to ensure normal function of our body.\\n\\nThe mineral elements are responsible for the maintenance of acid-base balance. The pH of the\\nbody fluids is maintained between a narrow range of 7.35 and 7.45. This function of mineral elements\\nin maintaining acid-base balance is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.\\n\\nDynamic Equilibrium\\n\\nAs in the case of other nutrients, there is a continuous turnover of minerals in body tissues; they\\ntake up minerals, synthesise new compounds and discharge waste matter. However, the healthy body\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor and Trace Minerals 119119119119119\\n\\nmaintains a very fine balance in all these processes, which is known as dynamic equilibrium. The\\nlevels of these minerals are regulated by hormones.\\n\\nThere are several ways by which this balance is maintained. One way is to release the mineral\\nfrom stores in the liver and bones; the second way is to control the absorption of the nutrient according\\nto the amount needed by the body and a third mechanism of control is to excrete the excess through the\\nkidney. The blood levels of these minerals are regulated by hormones.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances\\n\\nThe recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for each mineral element for the adult is given later.\\nThe  allowances for growth stages of life are higher per unit body weight than the adult stage. Unlike\\nthe major nutrients (carbohydrates, fats and proteins) which have high bioavailability (about 90 per\\ncent),  mineral elements vary a lot in the percentage that is absorbed from the diet. Thus iron absorption\\nmay be as low as 5 per cent; calcium 20 per cent, while sodium is absorbed almost completely.\\n\\nAbsorption of mineral elements is favoured by\\n\\n(a) Body requirement: If the body needs are high, as in pregnancy and growth stage of\\nchildren, there is higher absorption of calcium and iron (up to 60 per cent) from the diet.\\n\\n(b) Stomach acidity: Absorption of several minerals, for example, calcium and iron is improved\\nby the presence of acid conditions. Thus absorption of calcium in the intestinal tract is\\nenhanced by lactose, which is hydrolysed to lactic acid. The absorption of calcium, iron and\\nzinc is improved by ascorbic acid.\\n\\n(c) Form in which the mineral is present in the food: Haeme iron in animal foods is more\\neasily absorbed in the body than iron compounds present in plant foods.\\n\\nAbsorption of mineral elements is reduced by\\n\\n(a) Dietary components, which combine with mineral elements to form insoluble complexes,\\nreduce their absorption. These components include oxalic acid, phytic acid, excess fibre and\\nothers. Minerals are also bound by some medications.\\n\\n(b) The absorption of some minerals is adversely affected by an excessive intake of other\\nminerals. Such a situation arises when supplements of minerals are taken. For example,\\nintake of iron supplements hinders the absorption of zinc, while zinc supplements reduce the\\nabsorption of copper.\\n\\n(c) Increased mobility of intestinal track due to diarrhoea, intake of laxatives, etc., reduces the\\ntime of absorption and hence the amount absorbed.\\n\\n(d) Parasites present in the intestinal tract also interfere with the absorption of minerals. Iron\\ndeficiency anaemia in children is attributed to this factor.\\n\\nToxicity\\n\\nThe possibility of toxicity due to excessive intake of mineral elements from normal natural foods\\nis very remote.\\n\\nExcessive intaker, which can be toxic, is possible only when —\\n(a) Iron pills or other nutritional supplements are taken in excess\\n(b) errors are made in substituting supplements\\n\\n\\n\\n120120120120120 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n(c) Exposures to toxic levels of chemicals occur in an industrial plant.\\n(d) Children consume excessive number of iron pills accidentally.\\nEven common salt used in the kitchen can be toxic, if fed by mistake in excess to infants.\\n\\nMajor Minerals\\n\\nCalcium\\n\\nBody Composition and Functions: Bones and teeth contain about 99 per cent of calcium in the\\nbody, in combination with phosphorus, protein and other minerals. These give the skeleton structure\\nand rigidity. In the long bones, the calcium and phosphorus is stored mainly in the ends (trabeculae),\\nfrom where it can be easily taken to maintain  blood calcium levels.\\n\\nThe remaining 1 per cent of calcium is present in the soft tissue and blood and is responsible for\\nmany regulatory functions. These functions, which it carries out along with other minerals, are:\\n\\n• It is involved in normal muscle contraction, which includes heartbeat.\\n• Control of the transmission of nerve impulses.\\n• Maintenance of permeability of cell membranes to permit movement of material in and out of\\n\\nthe cells.\\n• Help normal clotting of blood.\\n• Activate action of enzymes, e.g., pancreatic lipase as a cofactor.\\n• Ensure the absorption of vitamin B12.\\n\\nFood Sources: The best source of calcium is milk. Infants receive an excellent supply of calcium\\nfrom their mother’s milk. The milk of cows, buffaloes and goats is rich in calcium. The calcium in milk\\nis accompanied by a favourable proportion of phosphorus, hence, it is very well utilised in the body.\\nMilk products such as curd, paneer, mava, SMP, are good sources of calcium.\\n\\nThe millet ragi and seasame seeds (til) have a high concentration of calcium. Green leafy vegetables\\nare a good source of calcium, though only a part of the calcium from these is available to the body.\\n\\nFresh as well as dried fish, especially small fresh fish, if the bones are also eaten, provide substantial\\nquantities of calcium in the diet.\\n\\nBesides these, some spices such as cumin seeds ( jeera), coriander seeds (dhaniya), contain\\nenough calcium to make a contribution, if these are used frequently in sufficient quantity, in the diet.\\nThe food sources of calcium are presented in Table 10.2.\\n\\nUtilisation of Calcium\\n\\nMost of the utilisation of calcium occurs from the small intestine (duodenum and jejunum) as\\ncalcium salts are more soluble in the acid medium there. As mentioned earlier, other factors which\\nfavour the utilisation of calcium are presence of vitamin D, ascorbic acid and lactose. More efficient\\nutilisation occurs in periods of rapid growth, such as pregnancy and childhood.\\n\\nThe presence of substances which form insoluble salts of calcium, e.g., oxalic acid (in leafy\\nvegetable), phytic acid (in cereal bran) and excess of fat in the diet, may hinder calcium utilisation.\\nExcess of fibre in the digestive tract may increase faecal excretion of calcium, thus reducing utilisation.\\n\\nDepending on the body’s need, 10 to 40 per cent of calcium from the diet is absorbed. The level\\nof calcium in the blood is maintained at a constant level, irrespective of the dietary intake, by the action\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor and Trace Minerals 121121121121121\\n\\nFoods Foods\\n\\nof hormones. Parathyroid hormone stimulates the kidney to alter vitamin D to its active form vitamin\\nD3 hormone, when the blood level of calcium is lower than  normal. Vitamin D3 hormone raises the\\nblood calcium level by increasing its absorption, drawing it from bones and decreasing its excretion by\\nthe kidney. Calcitonin  (another hormone) inhibits release from the bone and thus ensures normalcy.\\n\\nThe excretion of calcium is increased on a high protein diet. If such a diet is low in calcium, it\\nmay lead to negative calcium balance.\\n\\nTable 10.2: Food Sources of Calcium\\n\\nCalcium Calcium\\nmg/100g mg/100g\\n\\nMilk & Milk Products Green Leafy Vegetabls\\n\\nCow’s milk 120 Agathi 1130\\n\\nBuffalo milk 210 Amaranth (math) 397\\n\\nCheese 790 Fenugreek (methi) 395\\n\\nKhoya (mava) 956 Rape leaves 370\\n\\nSkim milk powder (SMP) 1370 Fish & Sea Foods\\n\\nCereals & Millets Hilsa 180\\n\\nRagi (nachani) 344 Rohu 650\\n\\nAmaranth seeds 510 Dry fish 500–6000\\n\\nRajgira seeds 223 Nuts & Oilseeds\\n\\nPulses & Legumes Gingelly seeds (til) 1450\\n\\nBengal gram whole 202 Mustard seeds (rai) 490\\n\\nHorse gram (matki) 287 Cumin seeds (jeera) 1040\\n\\nRajmah 260 Poppy seeds 1584\\n\\nGreen gram (mung) 124 Coriander seeds (dhania) 630\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances\\n\\nCalcium (Ca) requirement has been measured by long-term balance studies. Such studies among\\nWestern population, whose habitual diet contains high levels of calcium from milk, have indicated a\\nrequirement  of Ca of the order of 1 g. However population groups in many developing countries live\\non an intake of about 500 mg without any ill effects. Long-term balance studies in such population\\nindicate that they are in positive Ca balance even on much lower intakes. This is due to the ability of the\\nbody to adapt to different levels of intakes of Ca and maintain a positive balance. On the basis of these\\nstudies the earlier RDAs for Ca were suggested, which had given a range of intakes, as was also\\nrecommended by FAO/WHO.\\n\\nIn the 1989 revision, the evidence for Ca nutrition status of Indian population was examined, and\\nit was suggested that the earlier RDA be retained. Instead of a range, a single figure for each group is\\nsuggested as shown in Table 10.3.\\n\\n\\n\\n122122122122122 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIt may be noted that during periods of high demand such as pregnancy and lactation, more\\ncalcium intake is recommended.\\n\\nThe desirable intake of phosphorus was considered. Since phosphorus deficiency is unlikely in\\nthe types of diets consumed in India, adequate intake of phosphorus may not be a problem. It was\\nsuggested that a Ca: P ratio of 1 : 1 may be maintained in most age groups, except in infancy where the\\nratio suggested is 1 : 1.5.\\n\\nEffect of Deficiency: Deficiency of calcium manifests itself, only after years of insufficient\\nintake. When sufficient calcium is not supplied, pregnant women lose calcium from their body tissues\\nto supply the needs of the foetus. Similarly nursing mothers lose calcium and phosphorus for the\\nformation of milk.\\n\\nTable 10.3: A RDAs of Calcium and Phosphorus (mg/day)\\n\\nGroup Calcium Phosphorus\\n\\nAdult Men 400 400\\n\\nAdult Women 400 400\\n\\nPregnancy and  lactation 1000 1000\\n\\nInfants 500 750\\n\\nChildren 1–9 years 400 400\\n10–15 years 600 600\\n\\n16–18 years 500 500\\n\\nIf adequate calcium is not provided in the diet, during pregnancy and lactation, the bones of the\\nwomen get porous (osteoporosis). A large percentage of Indian women, especially form the low\\nincome strata, suffer from osteoporosis. In later years of life, these women suffer from loss of stature,\\nbent backs, high susceptibility to fractures of hip and wrist. These conditions, are due to loss of bone\\nmass, which results in bending, and compression of vertebrae.\\n\\nIn children lack of calcium affects their growth adversely. The skeletal frame does not mineralise\\nproperly, resulting in weak bones, which are unable to support the weight of the body. Rickets, which\\nis a manifestation of vitamin D and/or calcium deficiency, is characterised by bowed legs, enlarged\\njoints, beaded rib joints and other deformities. The teeth are also affected in calcium deficiency and the\\nblood does not clot normally.\\n\\nOsteoporosis is a complex ailment. The factors, which contribute to weakening of the bone\\nstructure, especially of senior citizen are:\\n\\n• Changes in lifestyle, leading to reduced movement,\\n• Lack of weight bearing exercise,\\n• as also poor absorption of calcium and phosphorus due to staying indoors (lack of vitamin D\\n\\nsynthesis).\\nThe best way to prevent osteoporosis is to maintain adequate calcium intake, physical activity to\\n\\nreduce loss of bone mass with age and exposure to sunlight to ensure vitamin D synthesis to aid\\ncalcium absorption.\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor and Trace Minerals 123123123123123\\n\\nPhosphorus\\n\\nBody Composition and Functions: Bones and teeth contain 85 per cent of the phosphorus in the\\nbody. The remaining 15 per cent is found in various compounds, which contribute to body function\\nand regulation. Thus functions of phosphorus are:\\n\\n• Body building as an important component of bones and teeth.\\n• Fat absorption and transport with aid of coenzyme A and ATP.\\n• As a part of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid), which are essential\\n\\nfor genetic coding and protein synthesis.\\n• As a part of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and ADP (adenosine diphosphate), which are\\n\\nessential for energy metabolism in the body.\\n• As a component of enzymes needed in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism.\\n• As a part of buffer salts, which maintain acid-base balance in the body.\\n\\nFood Sources: The diet which meets the body’s needs for calcium and proteins will also meet\\nthe body’s needs of phosphorus. Rich sources of phosphorus include milk, eggs, flesh foods, legumes\\nand nuts. Many processed foods and soft drinks have added phosphates.\\n\\nMagnesium\\n\\nBody composition and functions: Bones and teeth contain 60 per cent of the magnesium in the\\nbody.\\n\\nBesides body building, magnesium has three other important regulatory functions. Along with\\nother minerals, it regulates muscle contraction, regulation of the transmission of nerve stimuli and\\nactivates the function of many enzymes involved in metabolism.\\n\\nLike calcium, magnesium is absorbed in an acid medium in the gastrointestinal tract. in fact, they\\ncompete for carrier sites in this process. It is important not to have an excess intake of these elements\\nto avoid competition in absorption.\\n\\nFood Sources: Green leafy vegetables are a rich source of magnesium, as magnesium is a\\nconstituent of chlorophyll. Plant foods are also rich in magnesium.\\n\\nAs no deficiency of magnesium is likely to occur in the Indian population, no specific\\nrecommendations are made for its dietary intake.\\n\\nTrace Elements\\nIron\\n\\nFunctions: Though the amount of iron in the body is only about two to three grammes, its\\npresence is very important. Iron combines with protein for the development of haemoglobin, the red\\npigment of the blood. The main function of iron in haeme is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the cells\\nand to carry back some of the carbon dioxide formed, to the lungs for exhalation.\\n\\nIron is also an essential constituent of many tissues (muscles) and of the catalysts which regulate\\noxidation-reduction reactions in the body.\\n\\nIron is stored in the liver, spleen and bone marrow in the form of the protein ferritin. Men have\\nhigher stores of ferritin than women.\\n\\nFood Sources: Eggs, liver and meat contain iron in a readily available form. Among the plant\\nfoods, leafy vegetables, cereals such as whole wheat flour, rice flakes, an Italian millet, are good\\n\\n\\n\\n124124124124124 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFood\\n\\nsources of iron. Pulses, split and whole, treenuts, bajra, ragi, jowar and parboiled rice are also good\\nsources of iron. Table 10.4 gives the sources of iron.\\n\\nTable 10.4: Sources of Iron\\n\\nIron Iron mg/100g\\nmg/unit1 E.P.\\n\\nLeafy vegetables, dark green 2–30 5–60\\n\\nItalian millet, rice flakes, whole wheat flour 25 10–20\\n\\nRice, jowar, bajra, ragi 1–1.5 3–6\\n\\nPulses and treenuts 1–2 5–10\\n\\nFlesh foods (liver, meat), eggs 1 2–6\\n\\nOther Vegetables 1 2–5\\n\\nFruits 1 1–3\\n\\n1. Unit as indicated in Table 14.1.\\n\\nAs mentioned before, the availability of dietary iron in the body is promoted if it is in a soluble\\nform. Acidity favours iron absorption by dissolving the iron present. The presence of ascorbic acid\\nhelps iron absorption. A high cereal diet, which has high phytate, low calcium and low ascorbic acid,\\ntends to make much of the iron present unavailable to the body.\\n\\nUtilisation of Iron: Iron needs of the body are met by –\\n• Use of iron released from red blood corpuscles (RBCs) over and over again.\\n• Absorption of iron from the diet.\\n• Use of the stores of ferritin.\\n\\nAbsorption of iron from food takes place mostly in the duodenum and the small intestine. Only 3\\nto 10 per cent of iron is absorbed by a well nourished adult. Higher percentage is absorbed in growth\\nstages and by anaemic persons when need of the body is high. If the body has an immediate need for\\niron, it passes directly from the intestine into the blood stream. If the supply of iron is more than what\\nthe body needs, it is stored in the mucosa of the intestinal cells as ferritin. Ferritin is made up of a\\nprotein and an iron containing compound.\\n\\nDiet directly supplies only about one mg of iron as compared to the reutilisation of iron from the\\nbreakdown products of hemoglobin which supplies 25 mg. Since most of the iron produced from the\\nbreakdown of iron compounds in the body is reutilised, iron is known as one way element.\\n\\nRecommended Dietary Allowances\\n\\nThe Recommended Dietary Allowances for iron is presented in Table 10.5. It can be seen that the\\namount of iron needed is greater during pregnancy than any other stage of life. It helps the foetus to\\nstore iron, which last for the first few months after birth. Infants after six months of age, girls and\\nwomen, who lose blood in menstruation, need more iron than boys and men of the same age. Persons,\\nwho have suffered blood loss, because of blood donation, surgery or accident, also need more iron in\\nthe dietary than their normal intake.\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor and Trace Minerals 125125125125125\\n\\nParticulars Particulars\\n\\nDeficiency: Iron deficiency anaemia is quite widespread in India, the prevalence varying from 45\\nper cent in male adults to 70 per cent in women and children. While the main etiological factor is dietary\\niron deficiency, folate deficiency also contributes to anaemia among young children and pregnant\\nwomen.\\n\\nThe lack of iron results in anaemia due to insufficiency of haemoglobin, the iron containing\\npigment in  the blood. Persons lacking iron get tired easily, feel faint due to inability of the body to carry\\nsufficient oxygen to the cells for respiration. Iron deficiency anaemia poses a serious threat to\\n\\n• the ability of children to study and participate in games,\\n• the ability of women to face the stress of childbearing and nursing, and\\n• the ability of men to work satisfactorily.\\n\\nThus it affects the quality of life of a large part of our population. It is our duty to correct and\\nalter this situation.\\n\\nTable 10.5: RDA of Iron\\n\\nIron Iron\\nmg/day mg/day\\n\\nMan (60 kg) 28 Children\\n\\nWoman (50 kg) 30 Boys 10–12 years 34\\nPregnant woman 38 Boys 13–15 years 41\\nLactation 30 Boys 16–18 50\\n\\nChildren\\n1–3 years 12 Girls 10–12 years 19\\n4–6 years 18 Girls 13–15 years 28\\n\\n7–9 years 26 Girls 16–18 years 30\\n\\nIron Overload\\nWhen too much iron is absorbded, large amounts are deposited in the liver, lungs, pancreas and\\n\\nother tissues. Hemochromatosis is a genetic defect, in which there is excessive absorption of iron\\nresulting in organ damage and skin pigmentation. It may further lead to the cirrhosis of the liver.\\n\\nExcessive iron storage, without tissue damage, results in hemosiderosis—iron storage minus\\ntissue damage. It occurs when iron supplements are given for long periods even after it is not needed.\\nAbnormal breakdown of red blood corpuscles (RBCs) can also be the cause of hemosiderosis.\\n\\nIodine\\n\\nA small amount of iodine is required to keep our body healthy.\\nThere are about 25 to 30 mg iodine in the body. Of this about 33 per cent iodine is present in the\\n\\nthyroid gland. But iodine in minute traces is found in all cells of the body. Two hormones produced by\\nthe thyroid gland, viz., triiodothyroxine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) contain iodine. These hormones monitor\\nthe rate of energy metabolism in the body and thus are essential for growth and development.\\n\\n\\n\\n126126126126126 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nA deficiency of iodine is marked by a swelling of the neck with the enlargement of the thyroid\\ngland. This condition is known as simple goitre. The ashes of dry sea plants, which contain iodine,\\nhave been successfully used as medication for prevention of goitre for centuries in India.\\n\\nWhen mothers suffer from prolonged iodine deficiency, they give birth to babies, who are physically\\nand mentally deformed.\\n\\nThe amount of iodine in plants is dependent on the presence of the mineral in the soil. In mountainous\\nareas like the Himalayan regions, the iodine from the soil is washed away by rains and melting snow.\\nPlants that grow in these regions are very low in iodine content. Similarly the salts, mined in these\\nareas, known as rock salt do not contain any iodine. People in such areas used to suffer from goitre.\\nGoitrous regions of the world are shown in Figure 10.1 But nowadays, the salt is enriched by the\\naddition of iodine and cases of goitre are not that common wherever such enriched salt is provided.\\n\\nThe water of the oceans contains iodine. The sea plants and the fishes which feed on it are rich\\nsources of iodine. Salt obtained from the sea contains iodine. Vegetables which are grown in soils\\ncontaining iodine are also good sources of iodine.\\n\\nFigure 10.1: Goitrous regions of the world.\\n\\nOther Trace Elements\\n\\nBesides iron and iodine, a number of other trace elements are required by the human species.\\nThese are copper, zinc, selenium, cobalt, fluorine, molybdenum and manganese. Their functions are\\ngiven below.\\n\\nCopper is associated with iron in energy production.\\nZinc is an essential part of cell enzyme systems. It combines with insulin to form a storage form\\n\\nof the hormone. It is important in the immune systems as part of white blood cells.\\nSelenium functions as an essential part of an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells and their\\n\\nmembranes against oxidative damage and hence against cancer. In this way it spares vitamin E. It is\\nalso credited as a protective agent against mercury poisoning in animals. Reduced blood selenium\\nvalues have been reported in children suffering from protein-calorie malnutrition.\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor and Trace Minerals 127127127127127\\n\\nCobalt: The only known function of cobalt is its association with RBC formation as part of\\nvitamin B12.\\n\\nFluorine is necessary for resistance to dental caries.

If you weigh 50 kg, 31 kg of\\nthat weight is water (Figure 11.1).\\n\\nFigure 11.1: Water content of human body.\\n\\nApproximately 55 to 70 per cent of the total body weight is made up of water. The percentage of\\nwater tends to decrease as a person gets older. Thus infants and children have a much higher content\\nof water than adults. Fat individuals have less water than lean ones. Water is an essential nutrient next\\nonly in importance to oxygen. Deprivation of water even for a few days can lead to death.\\n\\nFigure 11.2: Body fluid compartments.\\n\\n45 kg.\\n28 litres\\nwater\\n\\n17 kg.

There is a variation in the water\\ncontent of various tissues. Metabolically active tissues such as brain, liver, blood and muscles contain\\nmore water than bone and fat tissue, which are less active. For example, blood plasma has 90 per cent,\\nmuscle tissue 75–80 per cent and fat tissue 20 per cent water.\\n\\nWater holds innumerable body components in solution or suspension. Therefore, it is more\\nappropriate to refer to these as fluids. The fluids, which exist inside the cells, are called intracellular\\nfluids, which form about 55 per cent of water in the body. The rest is found as extracellular fluid\\n(outside the cells). Blood, lymph circulation and interstitial fluid (fluid between cells or tissues) are part\\nof extracellular fluid (Figure 11.2).\\n\\nThe fluid balance is maintained between the compartments as also between blood and interstitial\\nfluid; kidneys are the final regulators of fluid balance.\\n\\nFunctions : Water serves as a  building material for each cell of the body.\\nWater is a universal solvent and is able to dissolve all the products of digestion. Further as it is\\n\\na constituent of all body fluids, it helps in the transport of the porducts of digestion to the appropriate\\norgans. For example, blood, which contains 90 per cent water, carries carbon dioxide to the lungs,\\nnutrients to the cells and waste nitrogenous material and salt to the kidneys. Urine which contains\\n97 per cent water has all the waste material dissolved in it and the body is thus able to excrete\\nsoluble waste products of metabolism. Water is needed for many chemical reactions to occur in the\\nbody. For example, the breakdown of sugar to simpler substances needs the presence of water. Water\\nacts as a lubricant preventing friction between moving parts of the body. The body temperature is\\nregulated  through the evaporation of water from the skin and lungs.\\n\\nTable 11.1: Water Balance in a Healthy Adult.\\n\\nWater intake Water loss\\n\\nWater intake — 800 to 1100 ml Urine — 800 to 1000 ml\\n\\nWater in food — 600 to 900 ml Vapour — 600 to 1000 ml\\n(skin & lungs)\\n\\nMetabolic water — 200 ml Faeces — 200 ml\\n\\nTotal 1600 to 2200 ml 1600 to 2200 ml\\n\\nNormal Losses\\nAs depicted in Figure 11.2, kidneys and lungs carry out water from the body. Water is also lost as\\n\\nperspiration through the skin and as part of excreta from the bowel (Table 11.1). The volume of urine\\nvoided depends on the intake of fluids and varies from 400 to 1400 ml.\\n\\nThe minimum or obligatory excretion of urine is about 600 ml to keep all the solutes (salt, urea,\\netc.) to be excreted in solution. Water is lost as vapour through the skin (insensible perspiration) and\\nalso as visible perspiration in hot weather and after strenuous activity.\\n\\n\\n\\nWater, Fluids, Electrolytes and Acid-base Balance 131131131131131\\n\\nWater Balance\\n\\nThe body normally maintains a water balance precisely, i.e., the amount of water ingested is equal to\\nthe water excreted or lost from the body (Table (11.1). This water balance is maintained even though\\nthe fluid intake may vary widely from day-to-day. How exactly this regulatory mechanism works is not\\nknown; but certain regions of the hypothalmus are believed to regulate the intake. The water excretion\\nis controlled by hormones.\\n\\nSources: The water we drink as such is the main source from which maximum water is obtained\\nby the human body. In addition to this, the intake of all beverages and liquid foods that contain water,\\ncontribute water to the system. Certain metabolic reactions carried on inside the body also release\\nwater and this is another source of water.\\n\\nIn a water balance study it was found that of the total 2200 ml available water in the system, 1100\\nml was obtained by drinking water as such, 900 ml was obtained from the diet and 200 ml obtained\\nfrom the metabolic oxidation (Table 11.1).\\n\\nRequirement: About 1 ml of water is needed per 1 kcal enery intake; thus about 2000 ml water\\nis necessary when energy intake is 2000 kcal. Infants who have a large body surface area, in proportion\\nto body weight, need 1.5 ml water/1 kcal energy intake.\\n\\nThe amount of water needed by an individual will depend on many factors such as the\\nenvironmental temperature, humidity, occupation and the diet. In general, apart from water\\nobtained in the food, an individual may need to drink about 1.5 to 2 litres of water per day. An athlete\\nor a player, playing a strenuous game such as football or hockey, may lose several litres of water and\\ndissolved salts during the game and would need replacement early. On the other hand, a sedentary\\nindividual would need much less water.\\n\\nProblems\\n\\nDehydration: When intake of water and other fluids is less than the body needs, dehydration\\noccurs. Dehydration is a serious medical problem, which needs prompt attention and remedial\\naction. Dehydration results from excessive loss of water due to vomiting and/or diarrhoea. Infants\\nwho have a high body water content and high water requirement get dehydrated very quickly, when\\nthey suffer from diarrhoea. If the loss of water and electrolytes is not promptly made up by feeding\\nbeverages such as oral rehydration solution, coconut water, weak tea, lemon sherbet, etc., the infant\\nmay not survive.\\n\\nVomitting due to either gastrointestinal disturbances or any other cause can lead to appreciable\\nloss of fluid from the body. Excessive perspiration due to strenuous exercise, while playing games\\nsuch as hockey, football can result in losses of many litres of water. Protracted fevers can lead to\\nappreciable loss of water due to perspiration. In all such instances where there is loss of water, it is\\nimportant to replace the water and soluble salts lost quickly to maintain body composition.\\n\\nAny loss more than 10 per cent of fluid from the body can be serious. Progressively, deprivation\\nof water can cause poor absorption of food, delayed elimination of wastes, elevation of body temperature,\\nfailure of the circulatory system and malfunctioning of the renal system.\\n\\nOedema is accumulation of excess fluid in the tissues. It occurs when the sodium content in the\\nextracellular fluid increases due to the inability of the kidneys to excrete sodium. Water is retained with\\nthe excess sodium, resulting in oedema. In protracted protein deficiency, the tissues are unable to\\n\\n\\n\\n132132132132132 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nensure water balance, and the oedema, which follows, is called nutritional oedema. Other conditions,\\nwhich lead to oedema, are kidney disease, cirrhosis of the liver and heart ailment.\\n\\nElectrolytes\\n\\nChemical compounds, which break up into their constituent ions, when dissolved in water, are\\nknown as electrolytes, because each carries an electric charge. The positively charged electrolyte is\\nknown as a cation and the negatively charged one as an anion. In an electrolyte solution, the total\\nnumber of cations are exactly equal to the total anions. Electrolytes are necessary to regulate the water\\nand acid-base balance in the body.\\n\\nSodium is the principal cation and chloride the anion in blood plasma. The other cations are\\npotassium, calcium and magnesium; other anions are bicarbonate, phosphate, sulphate, proteinate and\\norganic acids.\\n\\nIn contrast, inside the cell, the main cation is potassium and the main anion is phosphate. There is\\na strict maintenance of concentration of electrolytes in the fluids inside and outside the cell in a healthy\\nperson. Thus sodium stays mainly outside the cell and potassium inside the cell. Any change in the level\\nof electrolytes in the blood plasma is an early warning of disorder in the body.\\n\\nSodium\\n\\nSodium is an essential nutrient, which participates along with other minerals in many regulatory\\nfunctions.\\n\\nFunctions: The regulatory functions of sodium include normal muscle contraction, maintenance\\nof normal osmotic pressure, water balance and cell permeability, and transmission of nerve impulses\\nand regulation of acid-base balance. It facilitates the absorption of sugars and amino acids, through the\\nsodium pump.\\n\\nThe adult body contains about 85 g sodium; halt of it is in the extracellular fluid, about two-fifths\\nin the bone and about a tenth in the intracellular fluid.\\n\\nFood Sources: The main source of sodium in the diet is salt. It is used as a preservative in a\\nvariety of pickles. It is also used in processed foods, snack foods such as potato wafers and other\\nsavoury foods.\\n\\nOther sodium compounds used in food preparation include baking soda, baking powder,\\nmonosodium glutamate (MSG) (ajinomoto).\\n\\nThe typical diet contains about 500 mg sodium, when no salt or sodium containing salts are\\nadded during preparation. Most of this sodium is present in animal foods such as milk and meats. Most\\nof the plant foods, with a few exceptions are low in sodium.\\n\\nUtilisation: About 95 per cent of sodium intake is absorbed. The sodium not utilised is excreted\\nin the urine. Actually the sodium content of the body is regulated by the kidneys.\\n\\nRequirement: Dietary deficiency of sodium does not occur in normal circumstances, as common\\nsalt is a very cheap ingredient.\\n\\nSodium, which is available from common salt (sodium chloride) in the diet, helps to maintain the\\nfluid and acid-base balance of the body. People, who do rigorous exercises or who work in hot places\\nsuch as furnaces or mines, lose salt from the body in perspiration and urine, and so need an extra intake\\n\\n\\n\\nWater, Fluids, Electrolytes and Acid-base Balance 133133133133133\\n\\nof salt. Similarly, during the hot weather, when one perspires profusely, extra amount of salt is indiated\\nin the diet. Deficiency of salt in the diet may cause cramps of muscles, headache, tiredness or sickness.\\n\\nSalt may need to be restricted in diets of persons suffering from kidney or heart malfunction.\\nReduction of Sodium Intake: Hyperactivity in children has been found to be related to excessive\\nintakes of sodium from use of processed supplementary foods.\\n\\nIntake of salt in diets has increased with the increase in use of processed and readymade foods in\\nthe diet. There has been an increase in the incidence of heart ailments as also diabetes mellitus. Hence\\na number of health organisations recommend that most people would benefit by reducing their sodium\\nintake. Since the taste for salt is an acquired taste, it is possible to modify it.\\n\\nAn intake of 3 to 5 g salt is sufficient to prepare a palatable diet. The following changes will help\\nto reduce salt intake:\\n\\n1. Do not add salt on the table to foods.\\n2. Reduce the amount of salt used in preparation. Try ½ to ¾ amount of the amount used\\n\\nearlier.\\n3. Use minimal amounts of oil and spices in seasoning food, so that the amount of salt needed\\n\\nin preparation will be reduced.\\n4. Prepare desserts without adding salt.\\n5. Use a variety fo herbs and spices to flavour vegetables, meats and reduce the need for salt.\\n6. Use salty foods sparingly, e.g., pickles, papad, foods baked with soda, etc.\\n7. Read labels of processed foods to note presence of salt and sodium compounds and avoid\\n\\nthose with high sodium content.\\n\\nPotassium\\n\\nPotassium is primarily present in the intracellular fluid (about 12.6 g/per kg), so that the body is\\nable to conserve it.\\n\\nFunctions: Like sodium, potassium helps to maintain the normal osmotic pressure of the body\\nfluids and the acid-base balance of the body. It is also involved in muscle contraction and transmission\\nof nerve stimuli. It acts as an activator of several enzyme reactions in metabolism.\\n\\nFood Sources: Potassium is widely distributed in foods. Meat, fish and poultry are good sources.\\nFruits such as bananas, oranges, mausambi, lemons and vegetables like potatoes, carrots, leafy vegetables\\nand whole-grain cereals are also good sources of potassium.\\n\\nRequirement and Utilisation: About 3 to 7 g per day as potassium chloride, which is the intake\\nin ordinary diet, appears to be adequate. About 90 per cent of ingested potassium is absorbed from the\\nintestine, the rest is excreted in urine.\\n\\nDeficiency and Related Problems: Normally dietary deficiency of potassium does not occur.\\nBut persons, who take diuretics for weight reduction, may lose excessive amounts and need to consume\\npotassium rich foods to make up the loss.\\n\\nSevere vomiting, diarrhoea, diabetic acidosis may increase losses and thus precipitate a deficiency.\\nThe symptoms are the same as diarrhoea and need to be corrected promptly to avoid a fatal crisis.\\n\\nAbnormal elevation of blood plasma potassium known as hyperkalemia occurs in severe\\ndehydration and kidney failure, which needs immediate action. Rehydration fluids rich in sodium,\\npotassium and glucose/sucrose help to reverse the situation and pave the way to recovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n134134134134134 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nAcid-base Balance\\n\\npH: The concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution is referred to by the symbol pH. It is the\\nmeasure of acidity or alkalinity of the solution. Neutral pH, which is the pH of water, is 7.0. The pH\\nbelow 7.0 denotes acidity which increases with decrease in the pH. The alkalinity on the other hand,\\nincreases with increase in the pH.\\n\\nThe pH of body fluids is maintained in the narrow range between 7.35 and 7.45, which is\\nslightly alkaline. The maintenance of pH in this narrow range is known as acid-base balance.\\n\\nReactions of Foods: The foods which contain sizeable amounts of sulphur, chloride and\\nphosphorus, metabolise to form anions in excess of cations. Such foods are potentially acid producing\\nfoods. Acid producing foods include cheese, legumes, cereal foods, coconut, eggs and flesh foods.\\n\\nThe foods which produce excess cations on metabolism are termed alkali producing foods.\\nThese foods contain excess cations such as calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium. Fruits,\\nvegetables, milk, groundnuts, etc., are alkali producing foods.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the sour tasting fruits (citrus and other fruits) are alkali producing\\nfoods. So the taste of the food is not related to its metabolic reaction.\\n\\nThe third group of foods which are low in mineral elements are termed neutral foods. These\\ninclude sugar, starch, tapioca, oils, butter and other cooking fats.\\n\\nRegulation of Acid-base Balance: Mineral elements act as buffer salts, which prevent change in\\nthe pH. In the body the carbonate and the sodium phosphate buffer systems are important in pH\\nregulation. Proteins, which hydrolyse to form amino acids, containing an alkaline (NH2) an acidic\\n(COOH) group, are also good buffers.\\n\\nCarbonic acid is the main acid produced in metabolism, which is exhaled by the lungs as carbon\\ndioxide and water vapour. Breathing rapidly and deeply helps us to bring down the increased carbon\\ndioxide content of the blood.\\n\\nThis is the basis of for the recommendations for exercises, which make us breathe rapidly and\\ncleanse the blood.\\n\\nYoga, which teaches us to breathe deeply, ensures that oxygen reaches all the cells. Thus it helps\\nthe process of oxidation, which releases the carbon dioxide to be exhaled. The kidneys are able to\\nexcrete very acidic urine, when excess acid is produced in the body, thus preventing changes in blood\\npH. The kidneys act as the last regulators of acid-base balance.\\n\\nDisturbances in Acid-base Balance: If the pH of body fluids drops below pH 7.3, it is called\\nacidosis. When diabetes is not controlled, the patients suffer from acidosis and excrete large amounts\\nof ketones.\\n\\nIn severe starvation, the body fat reserves are metabolised in the absence of carbohydrate and\\nacidosis occurs. In renal failure, acidosis occurs, as the kidneys are not able to get rid of excess acid.\\n\\nIf the pH increases above 7.5., it is called alkalosis. Any condition which leads to loss of\\nstomach acid, results in alkalosis. Severe vomiting is one such condition. Another is excessive intake of\\nantacids such as sodium bicarbonate. Third is loss of hydrogen ions due to renal malfunction.\\n\\nAny change in pH needs immediate action to avoid disturbance in the metabolism and restore\\nnormalcy.\\n\\n\\n\\nWater, Fluids, Electrolytes and Acid-base Balance 135135135135135\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

Diet and nutrition does influence performance.\\n\\nExercise for Physical Fitness\\n\\nJust as eating three meals regularly is a consistent part of daily life, so should exercise be a\\nconsistent, regular part of daily life. In physical education in schools, activities that are appropriate for\\nlife-long participation need to be emphasised. This will ensure physical well-being and optimal function\\nof the majority of students. Some of them may become athletes.\\n\\nEnjoy Your Activities and Exercise\\n\\nThe cardinal rule of our body is conservation of energy. To keep an energy balance in adult life we\\nneed to learn to enjoy spending it. Voluntary exercise is an ideal way to use energy, as it helps us to stay\\nin shape and look good. It helps to improve posture, build muscle strength and increases flexibility of\\njoints. It strengthens the heart (a vital muscle) and improves circulation, which we refer to as the pink\\nglow of health. Naturally it relieves tension and helps us to enjoy life. The reduced risk of contracting\\nchronic diseases is an added bonus.\\n\\nHow to Select an Exercise Programme\\n\\nThe choice of an exercise programme varies from individual to individual. The word choice is\\nvery important for there are literally innumerable ways to attain your goal of fitness. The following are\\nthe guidelines to choose it:\\n\\n1. Choose an exercise you like so that you will enjoy doing it.\\n2. Choose one that can be done in all seasons.\\n3. Choose one that can be done preferably near your residence.\\n4. Choose one for which you have facilities.\\n5. Choose one that can be done regularly.\\n6. Choose an exercise that involves the large muscles in the body.\\n\\nPhysical Fitness Movement\\n\\nThe awareness about and interest in physical fitness is increasing in our people. It appears it is no\\nlonger a fad but a welcome trend. The longer one follows some type of regular exercise, the more\\ncommitted one becomes. Walking and soft workouts have enabled more persons to participate, who\\nare not athletically inclined. Many of these persons are middle-aged adults who control health problems\\nwith moderate exercise. They thus feel more in control of their lives.\\n\\n\\n\\n138138138138138 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nBeginning an Exercise Programme\\n\\nIt is important to begin an exercise programme with a proper plan. Strong motivation is necessary\\nto pursue an exercise programme on a long-term basis. Some of the basic guidelines for beginning are:\\n\\n1. Record weight, height, chest, waist and hip girth.\\n2. Initiate the programme gradually. As little as 3 to 5 minutes may suffice, for those who have\\n\\nbeen sedentary, especially older persons. Increase the period to 20 to 30 minutes over 3 to 4\\nweeks.\\n\\n3. 3 to 5 minutes warm-up period, which consists of smooth, stretching exercises, should\\nprecede intense exercise. At the end of intense exercise, decrease the intensity slowly to\\nallow the body to cool down.\\n\\n4. Aerobic exercises are most helpful to increase physical fitness.\\n5. Persons, who have chronic ailment or are overweight, should consult their doctor and\\n\\ncheck blood pressure, cardiovascular function, muscle and joint function before starting.\\nThe doctor may help to select the exercise programme and goals to be set.\\n\\nRequirements for Moderate Exercise\\n\\nFluids and Oxygen\\nFluids: More water is needed with increase in exercise. The need to replace fluid losses during\\n\\nexercise is well recorded. All cellular activities take place in an aqueous medium. Water carries nutrients\\nand waste products via blood stream to and from the cells. Thus sufficient blood volume is a must\\nto ensure loss of heat produced through skin and sweat. Water is lost from the body through sweat and\\nrespiration. Water for sweat is taken from blood, resulting in reduced blood volume, which may endanger\\nheart function. Significant fluid losses may reduce sweating and blood flow, disturbing body temperature\\nregulation. A water loss of 4 to 5 per cent reduces work capacity by 20 to 30 per cent; a 10 per cent\\nloss may result in circulatory collapse.\\n\\nThe fluid losses in exercise depend on the duration and intensity of exercise as also the ambient\\ntemperature and humidity. Normal sweat production, without exercise, is 500 to 700 ml per day. It may\\nincrease to 8 to 12 litres per day with prolonged exercise in humid conditions.\\n\\nElectrolytes: Though sweat contains electrolytes, chloride, magnesium and potassium,\\nperformance  is not disturbed by electrolyte losses. In hot months, during training, a dilute salt solution\\n(1/2 teaspoon salt per liter) may be used as a rehydration drink to correct excessive sweat losses\\n(American College of Sports Medicine, 1984).\\n\\nDuring exercise, as heat is released with energy production, the body temperature rises. One\\nsweats in an effort to control body temperature. The loss of water due to sweat must be made up to\\navoid dehydration. The amount of water needed in hot summer months is much more than in cool\\nweather.\\n\\nOxygen: Breathing ensures a constant supply of oxygen to the body. The need for oxygen\\nincreases with exercise, as more oxygen is needed to release extra body energy. The ability of the body\\nto provide the oxygen needed is known as aerobic capacity. The aerobic capacity is dependent on the\\nfitness of tissues involved in oxygen intake and transport — lungs, heart and blood vessels and the\\nbody composition.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition for Fitness, Athletics and Sports 139139139139139\\n\\nBody Fitness is measured in terms of aerobic capacity. Aerobic capacity is the ability of the body\\nto provide the increased demands for oxygen and use it during exercise. As it varies with the body size,\\nit is measured as the amount of oxygen consumed per kilogram body weight. Thus it is an indirect\\nmeasure of the health of the respiratory system.\\n\\nBody Composition: As mentioned in the energy balance chapter, the muscle mass (lean body\\nmass or the active metabolic tissues) in the body uses larger part of the oxygen. The aerobic capacity\\nis dependent on the percentage of lean body mass and body fat. Body composition is determined by\\nthese two components of body weight.\\n\\nNutritional Needs for Exercise\\n\\nNutrient Reserves\\nAny exercise activity increases energy expenditure. Proper diet is an essential prerequisite for\\n\\ngood performance be it for athletic competition or for just keeping fit. It is important to have nutrient\\nreserves to meet the demands during periods of exercise. If the reserves are used up, the body cannot\\nmeet its needs and fatigue and exhaustion may occur. As we know, carbohydrates and fats are the\\nbasic suppliers of these energy reserves, as very little is drawn from protein.\\n\\nCarbohydrate is the major nutrient to provide energy for exercise. Our body has two sources of\\ncarbohydrate reserves—the glucose in the circulating blood and the glycogen, stored in muscles and\\nliver. For an active person, the diet needs to provide 55 to 60 per cent of total dietary calories in the\\nform of complex carbohydrates as they break down more slowly and help maintain blood sugar levels\\nmore evenly. Secondly, starches are more readily converted to glycogen to maintain this reserve store.\\n\\nFat: There is no basis for increasing the level of fat in the diet. The total fat should not exceed 20\\nto 25 per cent of the total dietary calories. Vegetable oils, which are rich sources of essential fatty acids,\\nshould form a part of the total fat intake.\\n\\nProtein: It is important to meet one’s recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein. This\\nadds up to about 10 to 15 per cent of the total calories from protein. No additional protein is needed, as\\nit is not meant to serve as an energy source.\\n\\nVitamins and Minerals: They are essential only in the process of energy release as co-factors.\\nIn general, the efficient use of vitamins and minerals by the body is increased due to exercise. Hence\\nexercise per se does not increase the need for vitamins and minerals.\\n\\nThe athletes, who need more energy, take larger amounts of good food, which increases their\\nintake of vitamins and minerals. The only groups that need to focus special attention in this respect are\\nadolescent and female athletes, who may need iron supplements, if their blood iron levels are very low.\\n\\nExercise and Energy\\n\\nKilocalories: Physcial activity needs energy, i.e., kilocalories. The energy needed for various\\nexercises is given in Table 12.1.\\n\\nThe amount of energy used in exercise varies with —\\n(a) the intensity of the exercise\\n(b) the duration of the exercise\\n(c) the sex, age, weight of the individual\\n\\n\\n\\n140140140140140 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nActivity\\n\\n(d) the state of the individual and\\n(e) the level of training.\\nIn addition, it is affected by the rest taken during the exercise and the environmental conditions,\\n\\nsuch as temperature, humidity, the surfaces involved, the obstacles or physical difficulties, etc. (such\\nas hilly terrain during cross country running).\\n\\nEffects on the System. The need for calories is increased. Exercise helps to regulate appetite.\\nExercise is the only way to regulate the person’s body system and to regulate the body fat content.\\nLack of exercise tends to raise the body’s fat set-point, resulting in more fat stores. It is lowered when\\na person exercises regularly.\\n\\nTable 12.1: Approximate Energy Expenditure in Some Aerobic Activities1\\n\\nKilocalories per hour\\n\\nMale (60 kg) Female (50 kg)\\n\\nSitting, inactive 66 55\\n\\nWalking, moderate 167 139\\n\\nWalking, brisk (5.6 km/hr) 281 235\\n\\nBicycling (8.8 km/hr) 198 165\\n\\nBicycling (16.0 km/hr) 449 374\\n\\nDancing (moderate) 220 183\\n\\nGolf 277 231\\n\\nSwimming, moderate 290 242\\n\\nSwimming, vigorous 537 447\\n\\nTennis, singles 396 330\\n\\nRunnings (8.8 km/hr) 519 433\\n\\n 1. Modified from Robinson, et al., Basic Nutrition and Diet Therapy, 7th edn., 1993, p. 128.\\n\\nNutrient Ratios: As mentioned earlier, active persons, even athletes or any other sports persons\\nneed the same amount of protein and fat as an inactive person of the same body size.\\n\\nComplex carbohydrates are the fuel of choice before the exercise period and during the recovery\\nperiod, which follows. The recommended ratios of energy nutrients to support physical activity are:\\n\\nCarbohydrates : 60 to 70% of total kilocalories\\n\\nFats : 20 to 25% of total kilocalories\\n\\nProteins : 10 to 15% of total kilocalories\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition for Fitness, Athletics and Sports 141141141141141\\n\\nAthletic Performance\\n\\nNutritional well-being is important for all physical activities. Just as we save money, when we\\nintend to take a trip, so must our body stock reserve fuel before participating in athletic and sports\\nactivities. Many school children, high school and college students take part in competitive games, even\\nendurance races. Therefore, they need to know the dietary input that helps to improve their performance.\\nTable 12.1 gives approximate energy expenditure in some aerobic activities.\\n\\nEnergy: Athletes may need 3000 to 5000 kcal for most sports. Children and teenagers need\\nadequate energy to ensure normal growth and additional energy to meet needs during training and\\ncontests. Athletes gain unnecessary weight when they are not training or participating due to not\\nreducing energy intake to sedentary levels. This is true of dancers, soldiers, mountain climbers and\\nothers, whose extra energy need for their professional activity is periodical.\\n\\nPreparation for Athletics/Sports\\n\\nCarbohydrate: There is need to increase muscle glycogen stores prior to the competition. This\\nis known as carbohydrate loading. The carbohydrate intake (mainly starch from grains) is increased\\nslowly in the week before the event, beginning with 350g and increasing it to 450 to 500g in four days.\\nThe day before the event the intake is reduced to normal, and complete rest is recommended for the\\nday. Carbohydrate loading is used only by persons engaged in endurance activities such as marathons,\\nlong distance running, cycling, walking, swimming and cross-country skiing. Those involved in short\\nintense activities may find carbohydrate loading a hindrance to their performance, as it leads to a feeling\\nof heaviness, due to water retention. Children and teenagers should not attempt carbohydrate loading.\\nEven athletes should restrict it to three or four times in a year.\\n\\nPrecontest/Pregame Meal: Eat a light meal of about 300 kcal, two to four hours before the\\ngame/contest. It should be mainly cereal preparation, which is high in complex carbohydrate, low in\\nprotein, with little fat or fibre in it. This permits the body to digest and absorb and store it as glycogen.\\nFoods, which one can choose from, include pohe with toned milk or curds, chapati and dal; idli-\\nsambar, upma, bread, bhakri-zunka, etc.\\n\\nNutrition During Performance\\n\\nThe fluid and nutrient needs during a contest/game depends on the intensity and duration, as also\\nambient temperature and humidity.\\n\\nThe athlete cannot depend on thirst to meet fluid needs. The athlete should drink 400 to 500 ml\\ncool water two hours before the competition, another 400 to 500 ml 15 minutes before the event. He/\\nshe should drink 100 to 150 ml every 20 minutes, depending on the event and climate. He/she should\\ncontinue to drink fluids after the event until the preevent weight is restored. Plain cold water is normally\\nthe fluid of choice to ensure rehydration, except for endurance competitions or training rounds.\\n\\nErgogenic Aids\\n\\nWinning is the aim of all competitors in sports. Naturally they would like to use any substance\\nthat can aid their activity. These substances are known as ergogenic (work producing) aids. Most of\\nthese are worthless, except the steroids. The consumption of steroids is dangerous. These steroids are\\nsynthetic sex hormones. They have two functions:\\n\\n(a) Tissue growth (anabolic) and\\n(b) Masculinisation (androgenic).\\n\\n\\n\\n142142142142142 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThese are used to increase muscle size, strength and performance. Athletes often take these in\\nmega doses of 10 to 20 times that of normal body production. It is illegal to use steroids and those\\nwho use these are disqualified from participating in Olympic games.\\n\\nThe use of steroids is undesirable as it affects the health of the athlete adversely. The undesirable\\nphysiological effects include stunting normal skeletal development, liver injury, damaging the\\nheart, sterility and many more. The steroid user undergoes undesirable changes in his/her personality\\nsuch as being too aggressive, mood swings from depression to violent rage, etc. Becoming drug\\ndependent can be a serious handicap to normal life and health. In view of these long-term harmful\\neffects, sports persons should shun the use of hormones as aids to boost their performance. The adults\\nwho guide them — their parents, teachers, trainers and others — must ensure that the youngsters are\\nencouraged to develop long-term goals for a healthy competition and life-long health rather than succumb\\nto short-terms fame, followed by loss of health, unhappy disposition and loss of normal, dignified\\nhuman existence. The aim of sports is to improve one’s physical, social and ethical standards. This\\nbasic principle must guide all athletes and sportsmen.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

Undernutrition or lack\\nof adequate diet is a form of malnutrition which is most widespread. The causes of undernutrition are\\nmany and often interrelated.\\n\\nPoverty resulting in low purchasing power is one of the main causes of undernutrition because\\npoor families cannot buy adequate food for themselves.\\n\\nIn some communities, especially in rural areas, nutritious food such as milk may not be available\\nthroughout the year. Thus, sometimes even though families can afford to buy nutritious food, non-\\navailability may lead to malnutrition.\\n\\nIgnorance of the relation of foods to health is another reason for the prevalence of malnutrition.\\nFor example, sometimes protein rich foods such as milk, eggs and fish are not fed to the child on the\\nassumption that they are harmful to the child, even though the, family may be producers of milk or\\ncatching fish themselves.\\n\\nIncreasing urbanisation is another cause of malnutrition. A number of families flock from villages\\nto cities, hoping to find better means of livelihood. Often, living conditions for such families are even\\nworse than what they had in the villages. Overcrowding, insanitary environmental conditions, poor\\n\\n\\n\\n144144144144144 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nhygiene, contaminated water supplies are some of the problems encountered. In addition, not having\\nenough food; decreases resistance to infections, and exposes the family members to frequent attacks\\nof diarrhoea and other diseases. This intensifies the problem because what little food is consumed is\\nnot absorbed but lost.\\n\\nIn poor communities, because both parents have to work to maintain the family, the children,\\nespecially the younger ones, do not have anybody to take care of them and feed them at regular\\nintervals. Often, an elder child, who may only be a few years older than the infant, is left to take care\\nof the young ones. Without supervision by adults, the children are not fed properly and may develop\\nsymptoms of one or more deficiency diseases.\\n\\nThere is thus a vicious circle which encompasses poverty, ignorance, poor housing, disease and\\ninfection and unless this is broken by improving the economic condition of the low socio-economic\\ngroups, malnourishment of a huge sector of the population of the world cannot be eradicated. Figure\\n13.1 illustrates the close relationship between health, economics and social progress. It shows how\\npoverty engenders disease which in turn engenders more poverty.\\n\\nFoods contain a number of nutrients. When sufficient quantities of the right type of foods are not\\neaten, many essential nutrients are not available in adequate quantities to the body. This leads to the\\ndevelopment of several deficiency diseases. Some of the common deficiency diseases found are Protein-\\nEnergy Malnutrition (PEM ), vitamin A deficiency, anaemia due to lack or poor absorption of iron, and\\nvitamin B complex deficiency.\\n\\nFigure 13.1: Vicious circle.\\n\\nProtein Energy Malnutrition (PEM)\\n\\nProtein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) or Protein Calorie Malnutrition (PCM ) is the name given to\\nvarious degrees of nutritional disorders caused by inadequate quantities of protein and energy in the\\ndiet. This is one of the most widespread deficiency disease in India and covers abroad spectrum\\nranging from marginal deficiency with loss of weight and poor growth to a severe deficiency in which\\nthe body may have developed oedema or may have wasted away. Such deficiency occurs mainly in\\n\\nPoverty\\n\\nAbsence from work\\n(Poor Performance at work)\\n\\nFrequent\\nInfections\\n\\nLow Vitality\\n\\nLack of Energy\\n\\nPoor\\nNutrition\\n\\nInsufficient\\nFood\\n\\nPoor Housing\\nand Sanitation\\n\\nFrequent\\nInfections\\n\\nIgnorance\\n\\n\\n\\nDisorders of Nutrition 145145145145145\\n\\nchildren below five years of age, when they are weaned from mother’s milk and the diet substituted\\ndoes not supply sufficient protein and energy or protein only. When such lack has been prevalent for a\\nlong time in the community, the parents’ may fail to note the low weight and stunted growth of the\\nchildren.\\n\\nFigure 13.2: Kwashiorkor (a) changes in hair, (b) skin.\\n\\nOne of the names of the disease associated with protein energy malnutrition is ‘Kwashiorkor’, a\\nterm used by Cicely Williams in 1934 to describe this condition while working in West Africa. Kwashiorkor\\nmeans “the sickness a child develops when another baby is born”, in the language spoken in Ghana.\\nKwashiorkor occurs when there is not enough protein in the diet but calories or energy in the form of\\ncarbohydrates is available in sufficient quantity.\\n\\nHowever, when both protein and energy are insufficient, over prolonged periods, a condition\\nknown as ‘marasmus’ occurs in children.\\n\\nIn nutritional marasmus, there is also growth failure so that there is stunted growth. In addition,\\nbecause of their being not enough protein and calories in the diet, the protein from the body tissues is\\nused up for energy so that the child is all skin and bone. The child has an alert and hungry expression\\nby may not necessarily look miserable.\\n\\nKwashiorkor is characterised by growth failure, swelling of legs and feet (oedema), wasted\\nmuscles, a miserable expression and changes in the colour of the skin and hair. The hair changes to a\\nlight colour and becomes so soft that it can be easily pulled out. The skin develops rashes and also\\nbecomes lighter in colour (Figures 13.2 a, b, c, & d).\\n\\n\\n\\n146146146146146 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 13.2: (Contd...) Kwashiorkor (c), (d) recovery.\\n\\nBoth Kwashiorkor and Marasmus can be complicated with other infections due to intestinal\\nparasites and bacteria.\\n\\nThe reasons for the prevalence of protein calorie malnutrition are not difficult to find. Poverty as\\nhas already been discussed is the prime factor. The families do not have enough income to purchase the\\nnecessary nutritious foods. Ignorance of the relation of foods to health and nutritional well-being is\\nanother possible cause of protein calorie malnutrition. Apart from this improper distribution of foods\\ndue to controls, lack of proper transport and other such reasons make it difficult for consumers who\\ncan afford to buy, to get the necessary foods.\\n\\nIn rural communities, especially, the children are nursed by mothers over long periods and\\nsupplementary foods essential to prevent PEM are not provided at the proper age. Sometimes even\\nwhen supplementary foods are fed to the infant, they are insufficient and may not contain enough\\nprotein and calories. Bottle feeding has become a part of life in many communities. However, many\\nmothers do not have any knowledge of the precautions one has to take in using this method of feeding\\ninfants. Bottles and nipples are not washed properly after every feed; sometimes the milk is allowed to\\nstay in the bottle over long periods allowing growth of pathogenic organisms. These unhygienic feeding\\nhabits are predisposing factors which lead to diarrhoea and other intestinal disorders. In many households,\\nthe wage earner is served the food available in precedence over the needs of infants who may actually\\nbe in greater need of more protein and calories.\\n\\n\\n\\nDisorders of Nutrition 147147147147147\\n\\nPrevention of PEM through Dietary Management\\n\\nEradication of poverty, increase in purchasing power of the population and nutrition education\\nremain the most effective means of the prevention of PEM. Once there is enough economic freedom,\\na number of ways such as those given below can be used to combat the menace of PEM.\\n\\n(a) Prolong breast feeding as much as possible but at the right stage start feeding supplementary\\nfoods.\\n\\n(b) Make use of locally available vegetable and animal protein foods for feeding the child.\\n(c) Educate the mother and other members of the family about the correct diet for children.\\n\\nVitamin A Deficiency\\n\\nBesides Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) another principal nutritional problem is vitamin A\\ndeficiency. A direct result of vitamin A deficiency is impairment of vision ultimately leading to blindness.\\nIt is estimated that 9 million are blind and 45 million are visually handicapped in India. Maintenance of\\nthe blind costs the nation Rs. 81 crore and loss of production is estimated around Rs. 1080 crore\\n(Directorate of Health Services, Government of India). The number of people who have become blind\\ndue to nutritional deficiency of vitamin A runs into several lakhs. This deficiency is seen particularly in\\nthe rice eating southern and eastern belts of India.\\n\\nVitamin A deficiency is found more in children than in adults. Among children, the male child\\nseems to be more affected than the female child. Pregnant women are also, however, susceptible to\\nthis deficiency. Recent survey of children estimates that 3 to 8 per cent of all pre-school children and\\n10 to 15 per cent of all school children suffer from vitamin A deficiency. The average percentage of all\\nchildren suffering from this deficiency works out to ten. As long as children are breast fed which is\\nusually from six months to one year, there is no sign of vitamin A deficiency. However, in the lower\\nsocio-economic groups, once the breast milk is withdrawn, the diet does not seem to supply enough of\\nthis vitamin.\\n\\nVitamin A is necessary for growth, and lack of it could result in stunted growth and abnormalities\\nof bones and teeth. Deficiency of the vitamin also leads to dryness of the conjunctiva of the eye and\\ncloudiness of the cornea. At this stage night blindness may be observed. Severe deficiency of vitamin\\nA results in the cornea becoming dry and losing its transparency thus having a hazy appearance.\\nDuring the next stage the cornea become soft and may fall off resulting in total blindness (Figures\\n13.3a and b).\\n\\nThe principal causes of vitamin A deficiency is lack of adequate supply in the diet. Though\\nvitamin A is present only in animal foods its precursor beta-carotene is present in green leaves, ripe\\nmangoes and other fruits. In fact, experiments have shown that an intake for 15 days of green leaves\\nby pre-school children whose diets were deficient in vitamin A improved their Serum vitamin A level.\\nPoor absorption of vitamin A and carotene due to lack of fat in the diet, gastro-intestinal disorders, liver\\ndisease and other metabolic abnormalities can also result in vitamin A deficiency.\\n\\nAttempts have been made to distribute vitamin A and D in capsule form and skin milk powder\\nfortified with vitamin A through health centres to children especially in rural areas to prevent vitamin A\\ndeficiency. These have not been very successful because it is not possible to find the same pre-school\\nchild every two or three days to feed these supplements.\\n\\nAs vitamin A is stored in the liver for prolonged periods, attempts have been made to administer\\norally massive doses such as 60,000 mcg of vitamin A to school children half yearly. Experiments\\n\\n\\n\\n148148148148148 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ncarried out during the past seven years have shown that 84 per cent of the children were protected\\nfrom vitamin A deficiency when such massive doses were given. Oil preparations containing the\\nvitamin were effective and had very little toxic effects. In view of these findings, the Family Planning\\nDepartment of the Government of India has launched a programme in several regions of this country\\nwhere there is deficiency of vitamin A to administer massive dosage of vitamin A to pre-school children\\nat annual intervals.\\n\\n(b)\\n\\nFigure 13.3: Vitamin A deficiency.\\n\\n(a)\\n\\n\\n\\nDisorders of Nutrition 149149149149149\\n\\nIron Deficiency Anaemia\\n\\nIron deficiency anaemia is a major nutritional problem in our country. The age groups affected\\nare women in of reproductive age, pregnant women and pre-school children especially from low\\nincome groups (Figures 13.4 (a) & 13.4 (b)]. Its prevalence ranges from 60 to 70 per cent in women\\nand children, and 30 to 40 per cent in among adult males and older children in most parts of the\\ncountry.\\n\\nDeficiency of iron causes anaemia, a condition in which there is a decrease in the haemoglobin\\ncontent of the red blood cells (erythrocytes), and there is an alteration in their size and shape. Hence\\nhaemoglobin content of blood has been used to study the incidence of anaemia. Determination of\\nhaemoglobin level in the blood of large numbers of people in different age groups in many parts of the\\nworld, has helped to establish standards with which the results of field studies can be compared.\\n\\nHaemoglobin studies of large numbers of school children in India, have shown that more than 50\\nper cent of them have haemoglobin levels less than 10.8 g per 100 ml. Similarly the haemoglobin levels\\nof more than 50 per cent pregnant women, attending rural health centres, was found to be less than 10\\ng per 100 ml.\\n\\nThe major cause of anaemia in our country is iron deficiency due to inadequate intake of dietary\\niron and/or its poor absorption, from the cereal based diets consumed by people. Iron intake in the diets\\nof low socio-economic groups has been found to be around 20 mg per day in adults and 6 mg per day\\nfor pre-school children. These amounts of iron intake are considered to be marginal due to the high\\nphytate content of the diets, which render part of the iron unavailable to the body. However, it has been\\nobserved that if sufficient amounts of vitamin C and calcium are provided, iron can be absorbed even\\nin the presence of phytates.\\n\\nFigure 13.4: (a) Anaemia\\n\\n\\n\\n150150150150150 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure  13.4: (b) Anaemia\\n\\nLoss of iron through sweat is possible and in a tropical country like India, it has special relevance.\\nLoss of blood through hook-worm infestation is another cause of iron deficiency. The infestation\\nappears to be more in wet areas than dry areas. In such areas anaemia is found to be present in all age\\ngroups and sex groups, including men. Low iron intake coupled with hook-worm infestation thus\\nposes a serious community health problem. Anaemia could also be due to loss of excessive blood in\\nmenstruation and during child birth in women. Haemorrhages, due to accidental injury or other causes,\\ncould also deplete haemoglobin from the body, which if it is not replaced, could lead to anaemia.\\n\\nAnaemia develops slowly and is usually not noticed in early stages. In anaemia, since the\\nhaemoglobin level in the blood is reduced, the supply of oxygen to the cells is reduced. Therefore,\\nphysical activity is considerably lowered, which results in reduction in working capacity of the person.\\nIf we consider the high prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia, we may realise the magnitude of economic\\nloss in the India, due to reduced work capacity of a large percentage of the population.\\n\\nThe incidence of anaemia can be reduced by improvements of dietary habits. These are inclusion\\nof leafy vegetables, which provide iron; vitamin C and calcium, and pulses, which provide protein, iron\\nand B vitamins. Since change in dietary habits is a slow process, some interim public health measures\\nhave been taken to reduce the incidence of anaemia. These include distribution of tablets containing\\niron and folic acid to pregnant women at primary health centres and iron supplements to school children.\\n\\nIn addition to these programmes, the control of parasites associated with blood loss (like hook-\\nworm) need to be given top priority to reduce the incidence of anaemia. It would also be necessary to\\nimprove environmental sanitation to eradicate infection with parasites.\\n\\nAnother practical method to combat and prevent iron deficiency anaemia is to increase iron intake\\nin the diet through fortification of a universally consumed dietary article with iron. In the Indian\\ncontext, salt has been indentified as a suitable vehicle for fortification, as it is consumed by all in a fairly\\nuniform amount. The iron fortified salt has been found acceptable in trial experiments. It has been\\ntested among anaemic children and rural and urban communities. It was observed that the prevalence\\nof anaemia was reduced significantly, when iron fortified salt was consumed over a period of 12 to 18\\nmonths. The fortified salt is now being introduced in two districts of one state through public distribution\\nsystem. The results obtained in this trial will guide the ultimate introduction of iron fortified salt in the\\ncountry.\\n\\n\\n\\nDisorders of Nutrition 151151151151151\\n\\nThus a mufti-faceted approach is being used to control and prevent the incidence of iron deficiency\\nanaemia.\\n\\nVitamin B-complex Deficiency\\n\\nThe overall prevalence rate of vitamin B-complex deficiency is estimated to be about 20 per cent\\nin India (Figures. 13.5a, b and c).\\n\\nFigure 13.5: B-complex deficiency.\\n\\n(a) (b)\\n\\n\\n\\n152152152152152 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nSome of the common symptoms of vitamin B-complex deficiency are sore mouth, sore tongue\\nand erosion at the angles of the mouth. These symptoms are widespread in the community, more so\\namong the ill fed children of the low socio-economic groups.\\n\\nLow intake of these vitamins in the diet is the primary cause of deficiency. This is compounded\\nby gastro-intestinal infections, such as diarrhoea and dysentery, in which even the little vitamins ingested,\\nmay be flushed out before absorption. During pregnancy and lactation, the need for the B vitamins is\\nincreased, if there is no extra intake of the vitamins in the diet, deficiency symptoms may occur. It is\\nobserved that chronic alcoholics suffer from thiamin deficiency, as the need for thiamin increases with\\ningestion of alcohol.\\n\\nFood processing methods affect the vitamin content of the products. For example, thiamin and\\nniacin are partially lost in refining and polishing of cereals, such as rice and wheat. Parboiling helps to\\nconserve these vitamins and in regions of the country like Kerala, where parboiled rice is consumed,\\nincidence of thiamin deficiency, is rare. However, marginal deficiency could still exist in homes in rice-\\neating areas, if practices such as excessive washing of rice before preparation and discarding the water\\nin which rice is cooked are still prevalent.\\n\\nBeri-beri, a disease caused by thiamin deficiency, used to be endemic in the coastal parts of\\nAndhra, especially where the rice polished in mills was used. But recent surveys show that there is not\\nmuch evidence of the disease. The enactment of laws making under-milling compulsory and improvement\\nin the technology of milling may be one of the reasons for reduction of this deficiency. Another reason\\npossibly is the change in dietary habits of the people, such as inclusion of foods such as wheat and\\nwheat products, which contain thiamin, in the diet.\\n\\nBeri-beri, which is caused by deficiency of thiamin, can affect children as well as adults. The\\nmost serious victim is the baby of a mother, who does not secrete enough milk and has little thiamin in\\nher milk. In such thiamin deficient infants, one of the symptoms is the visible cry in which the child\\nappears to be crying, without making any noise. The disease occurs between the first and fifth month\\nand it strikes suddenly and could result in death, if no adult is looking after the child, when the mother\\nis away at work. Little siblings, who may be in-charge, may not realise that the infant is crying and is\\nin need of nourishment.\\n\\nIn adults, thiamin  deficiency could result either in dry beri-beri or wet beri-beri. Dry beri-beri is\\ncharacterised by arms and legs wasting away, losing their sensation. Wet beri-beri is accompanied by\\nswelling of the limbs and impaired function of the heart; it could ultimately result in death due to cardiac\\nfailure.\\n\\nRiboflavin deficiency is frequently observed in children and some adults among the low income\\ngroups in India. The symptoms of this deficiency are cracks in the skin and corners of the mouth,\\nknown as cheilosis. These cracks have a raw appearance and are slow to heal. The eyes turn red blood\\nshot due to the cornea becoming crowded with capillaries. There is a tendency to avoid bright light.\\nThis is known as photophobia.\\n\\nThe deficiency of niacin occurs, when the staple cereals are highly refined and intake of dals and\\nlegumes is meagre. Niacin deficiency is called pellagra (rough skin) and it affects the skin, the gastro-\\nintestinal tract and the nervous system. There are rashes on the skin (dermatitis), which at times can\\naffect the whole body (Figure 13.6). Diarrhoea is another symptom, which is frequently observed.\\nThe effect on the nervous system results in lack of alertness, anxiety and irritability. This could slowly\\ndevelop into a situation in which the person affected may become mentally confused and could even\\n\\n\\n\\nDisorders of Nutrition 153153153153153\\n\\nlead to insanity. These severe effects on the nervous system are termed dementia. If the deficiency is\\nnot corrected in time, it could result in death.\\n\\nSporadic incidence of pellagra, a disease occurring due to severe deficiency of niacin, is reported\\nfrom regions, where jowar (sorghum vulgare) is the staple. Jowar is not low in niacin  and tryptophan,\\nthe amino acid from which it can be synthesised in the body. The studies carried out at the National\\nInstitute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, seem to indicate that amino acid imbalance (high leucine/low iso-\\nleucine) may be the cause of pellagra prevalent in the regions, where jowar is the staple food. This is\\nmore so during lean periods when jowar may be the only source of nourishment and other foods to\\nsupplement the staple are not available. New strains of jowar with lower concentrations of leucine\\nhave been developed to prevent the sporadic occurrence of pellagra.\\n\\nFigure 13.6: Pellagra\\n\\n\\n\\n154154154154154 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThus thiamin deficiency could be corrected by taking care to see that the rice is either undermilled\\nor parboiled. Inclusion of other foods rich in thiamin such as wheat and wheat products, could help\\nremove thiamin deficiency. Use of milk and milk products and other foods, which are rich sources of\\nriboflavin, could prevent riboflavin deficiency. Groundnuts are a rich source of niacin and very much\\nliked by most people. Use of a combination of cereals, pulses and inclusion of groundnuts, would help\\nprevent B-complex deficiency.\\n\\nIodine Deficiency Disorders (IDD)\\n\\nIodine deficiency in man leads to a number of disorders, which include goitre, cretinism, mental\\nretardation, deaf-mutism, neuropsychic retardation and myxoedema in elderly. From the socio-economic\\npoint of view, endemic neuropsychic retardation may  be the most important of the iodine deficiency\\ndisorders. One is often struck by the number of superficially normal-looking persons in the endemic\\nregions, who on closer observation are found to be mentally subnormal or have mild defects in their\\nmotor function or have both these lacks simultaneously. It has been observed that large numbers of\\ncases of mild or moderate retardation in intellectual, motivational or neuromotor maturation occur in\\nconjunction with endemic goitre. In order to focus attention on this multifaceted nature of iodine\\ndeficiency, these disorders are now referred to as iodine deficiency disorders and not goitre.\\n\\nFig. 13.7 Goitre\\n\\n\\n\\nDisorders of Nutrition 155155155155155\\n\\nAccording to official estimates, 145 million people in India live in the goitre-endemic regions, and\\n40 million are actually suffering from goitre. Apart from the sub-Himalayan states, which were always\\nknown to be goitre-prone, recent surveys have shown the presence of endemic pockets in Andhra\\nPradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharastra, Bihar, Gujarat end Kerala as well. In all endemic goitre pockets\\nhave been observed in 17 states to varying extent.\\n\\nIn the endemic areas of goitre, a number of disorders are observed in children. There is retardation\\nof physical growth, as also lack of mental development. A number of deaf-mutes have also been\\nobserved in these area. The ultimate sequel is occurrence of cretinism in children born to women, who\\nwere so severely depleted that they could not provide iodine for proper development of the foetus.\\nCretins are dwarfs. Cretins have low basal metabolism, and suffer from muscular weakness, dry skin,\\nmental retardation and their skeletal development is arrested. If desiccated thyroid is given to such\\ninfant, early enough, there is noticeable improvement in physical development, mental retardation may\\nbe less severe, but any damage, which may have taken place in the central nervous system, cannot be\\nreversed.\\n\\nGoitre results in enlargement of the thyroid gland, as is seen in Figure 13.7. Girls and women are\\nmore susceptible to goitre than boys and men.\\n\\nThe simplest way of eradicating iodine deficiency is by addition of iodine to the diet. Salt is a very\\nconvenient vehicle for addition of iodine. This procedure is inexpensive and within the technological\\ncapability of our country. It has been used since the 1950s. The efficacy of use of iodised salt to reduce\\nthe prevalence of IDD has been demonstrated under Indian conditions. However, there have been some\\ndifficulties in the distribution of iodised salt and the progress in eradication of this deficiency has been\\nslow.\\n\\nIn view of the high incidence of the deficiency and its deleterious effects on the health of future\\ngeneration, there has been a new momentum in the implementation of iodine prophylactic programmes\\nin the developing world. In India, the government has decided to extend the salt iodation programme to\\ncover the entire country by 1993 in a phased manner.\\n\\nIn view of the high incidence of anaemia in the country, now attempts are being made to fortify\\nsalt with both iron and iodine. The technological aspect of this process have been successfully completed.\\nThe doubly fortified salt is going to be field tested in Uttar Pradesh and A ndhra Pradesh. When these\\nstudies are successfully completed; we can hope to eradicate two debilitating deficiency diseases—\\nIDD and anaemia, by use of fortified salt. It will be our duty to educate the public about the importance\\nof using the fortified salt.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. Discuss the reasons of malnutrition among Indians.\\n2. What is PEM?

You need a plan to select an adequate diet so simple and attractive that\\neveryone including you, a young student as also the elderly family members can understand and follow\\nit. The experts have devised such a plan. This practical plan, known as a food guide, helps to ensure\\ngood nutrition through proper food selection.\\n\\n\\n\\n160160160160160 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nEnergy, protein, iron, thiamin, niacin,\\nfibre\\n\\nProteins, energy, calcium, iron, B-\\ncomplex vitamins, invisible fat, fibre\\n\\nCarotenoids, vitamin C, iron,\\ncalcium, folic acid, fibre\\n\\nVitamin C, carotene, fibre\\n\\nSupplementary sources of minerals,\\nvitamins and fibre\\n\\nEnergy, fat, essential fatty acids\\nEnergy\\n\\nDevelopment of a Food Guide\\n\\nSeveral factors have to be considered in developing a food guide for a large country like India.\\nSome of the relevant factors are:\\n\\n• Foods plentifully available and normally used in the dietary.\\n• Normal meal pattern.\\n• Recommended dietary intakes of nutrients for Indians.\\n• Need to emphasise some foods because of prevailing nutritional deficiencies in the country.\\n\\nAs you know, food availability and meal patterns vary from one country to another. Therefore, a\\nfood guide for one country, such as the Basic Four used in the USA, is not suitable for use in India,\\nwhere meal pattern, food availability and cost are different. This is one of the reasons for developing a\\nfood guide for India.\\n\\nIn developing a food guide, the foods are classified on the basis of their use and the major\\nnutrients which they provide. Such a classification can serve as a guide for the selection and use of\\nfoods. For example, cereals, dals, and leafy and other vegetables are such classes. Most preparations\\nuse oils and fats as a seasoning, and jaggery or sugar as a sweetener. These foods, which enhance food\\nacceptability, can be one of the food groups. This is how the food guide is developed.\\n\\nThe five food groups suggested by ICMR and their nutritional contribution is presented in Table\\n14.1.\\n\\nTable 14.1: Nutrient Contribution of the Five Groups\\n\\nFood Group Foods Included Main Nutrients\\n\\n1.

The food groups are chosen because of the specific nutrients contributed\\nby each to the total diet. Foods have been assigned to the groups on the basis of their composition. The\\nfood guide is designed to direct selection of foods and quantities consumed to provide by RDA, thus\\nforming the foundation of our adequate diet.\\n\\nAs you may observe, the first column in the table indicates the food group, the third column\\nspecifies the amount in one serving, and the last column indicates the minimum number of servings to\\nbe taken to meet your nutritional needs. If sufficient amounts of foods from each of the five groups are\\nincluded in the day’s diet, the nutrient requirements of the body will be met. Such a diet is a balanced\\ndiet, as it meets the person’s nutritional needs.\\n\\nLet us study each food group in details, so that we can use the food guide as a practical tool.

These foods provide more than half our body’s daily need for energy and proteins. In addition,\\nif the whole grain or its flour is used in the preparation, these foods can be a valuable source of thiamin\\n(one of the B vitamins) and iron.\\n\\nThe foods in the group include rice, wheat, jowar, bajra, makka (maize or corn), ragi or nachani,\\nand cereal products such as rawa (suji or semolina), rice flakes (pohe, aval), senvaya (vermicelli), etc.\\n(Figure 14.2).\\n\\nFigure 14.1: A daily food guide.\\n\\n1.

This is equal to half a katori of cooked rice, one medium chapati, two phulkas, two or three\\npuries, half a medium roti or bhakari, two slices of bread, two tablespoons of rice flakes (dry, not\\nsoaked), or two tablespoons of ready-to-cereal.\\n\\nSuggested number of servings: A sedentary person may need about ten servings. Those who\\nneed more servings of foods in this group are:\\n\\n• Teenagers.\\n• Expectant mothers (latter half of pregnancy) and nursing mothers.\\n• Persons involved in heavy physical work such as lifting and carrying heavy loads, agricultural\\n\\nwork, pulling rikshaw, etc.\\n• Players who practice for hours games such as badminton, tennis, squash, hututu, khokho,\\n\\netc.\\n• Persons whose hobbies involve intense physical exertion for some hours each day.\\n\\nFigure 14.2: Group 1 — Cereals & their products.\\n\\nExpectant mothers, in the latter half of pregnancy, need two servings more than their normal\\nintake, while nursing mothers may need four servings more than their normal intake.\\n\\nGroup 2: Protein Foods\\nThis group includes the major sources of proteins in our dietary, such as dals, whole pulses, milk,\\n\\neggs, fish, poultry and meat (Figures 14.3 & 14.4). A third or more of our protein requirement is met\\nby these foods. These foods are not only good sources of proteins, but also of minerals and vitamins.\\nDals, eggs, and meat are good sources of iron. In addition, milk is a very good source of calcium and\\nriboflavin. Milk, eggs and liver are rich in vitamin A. These foods also supply part of our requirement\\nof the B vitamins. The foods in this group are varied in their composition. Therefore, the serving size\\nof these foods varies as given below:\\n\\nDals and whole legumes or pulses 25 g\\nMilk and milk preparations 1 medium cup or 150 ml\\nEgg (medium size 50–52g) 1 No.\\nFish, meat and poultry 25 to 30 g\\n\\n\\n\\n164164164164164 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 14.3: Group 2—Plant protein foods.\\n\\nFigure 14.4: Group 2—Animal protein foods.\\n\\nOne serving of each of these foods provides about 5 to 6 programmes of protein.\\nSuggested number of servings: The number varies with the person’s age and body size. For\\n\\nexample, an adult woman may need 3 servings, whereas a teenager may need 5 servings.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Guides for Selecting an Adequate Diet 165165165165165\\n\\nGroup 3: Protective Vegetables and Fruits\\n\\nThe protective vegetables and fruits are rich sources of beta-carotene or provitamin A and ascorbic\\nacid or vitamin C. To emphasise these sources, the group is divided into group 3(a)  and group 3(b).\\n\\nGroup 3(a) — Vitamin A Rich Green and Yellow Vegetables and Fruits\\n\\nThis group is a rich source of pro-vitamin A, and includes all dark green leafy vegetables such as\\nmath (amaranth), palak (spinach), methi (fenugreek), radish leaves, colocasia leaves, etc. It also includes\\nlight green leafy vegetables such as cabbage, onion tops, and lettuce, and yellow-orange vegetables and\\nfruits such as carrots, pumpkin, mangoes, papaya, oranges, cantaloupe (turbuz), apricots, etc.\\n(Figure 14.5).\\n\\nAll of these vegetables and fruits share one common component, which brings them together in\\none group. This component is the yellow plant pigment beta-carotene, which is a precursor of vitamin\\nA. One serving of this group provides 75–120 per cent of our day’s need of vitamin A. In addition, the\\ndark green leafy vegetables provide about 50 per cent need for vitamin C.\\n\\nServing size: One serving is 50 g of the vegetables or fruit, or half a katori of cut vegetables or\\nfruit.\\n\\nSuggested number of servings: It is suggested that one or more servings a day be included\\nfrom this group. In practice, you can include dark green leafy vegetables three times a week, yellow —\\norange vegetables two times a week, and light green vegetables two times a week.\\n\\nFigure 14.5: Group 3(a) & (b) Protective vegetables & fruits.\\n\\n\\n\\n166166166166166 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nGroup 3(b) — Vitamin C Rich Vegetables and Fruits\\n\\nIn this group we have rich sources of ascorbic acid, which is also known as vitamin C. A tropical\\ncountry such as India has a number of rich sources of vitamin C, which are not found in temperate\\nregions, and hence are not mentioned in the Western food guides. For example, the richest source of\\nvitamin C in the tropics is amla (Indian gooseberry), which contains ten times as much vitamin C as\\nany citrus fruit. Guavas, cashew apples, bor, cabbage, and drumsticks (both leaves and pods) are\\nexcellent sources of vitamin C, and contain 3 to 6 times the amount provided by citrus fruits.\\n\\nBesides these, we have a variety of citrus fruits such as oranges, mausambis, pummelo, grapefruits,\\netc., and other fruits such as papaya, mangoes, pineapples and tomatoes, which are also good sources\\nof vitamin C (Figure 14.5).\\n\\nServing size: Generally, one serving is a 50 g portion or half a katori of cut vegetable or fruit.\\nThere are some exceptions to this serving size, when we choose a very concentrated source. For\\nexample, you need only one amla, or 25 g of guava or cashew apple to comprise a serving.\\n\\nSuggested number of servings: One or more servings a day is suggested. One serving provides\\nhalf or more of our day’s need for vitamin C. Please remember that some vegetables and fruits are good\\nsources of both beta-carotene and vitamin C. Some examples of these are cabbage, drumstick leaves,\\namaranth, oranges, mangoes and papaya. If you choose one of these, you will take care of the servings\\nfrom both group 3(a) and group 3(b).\\n\\nGroup 4: Other Vegetables and Fruits\\n\\nAll the vegetables and fruits not mentioned as part of Group 3(a and b) are included in this group.\\nThe members of this group are:\\n\\nFruit and flower vegetables — cucumber, cauliflower, brinjal, capsicum, ladies finger, etc.\\nGourds — ash gourd, bottle-, snake-, bitter-, ridge-, sponge gourd and others. Immature beans\\n\\nand peas — french beans, cluster beans, chawli, red gram (tender), walpapdi, etc.\\nRoots and tubers — beetroot, radish, potatoes, yams, onion, etc.\\nOther Fruits — bananas, melons, grapes, apples, jackfruit, plums, berries, chikus (sapota),\\n\\npears, plantain, litchis, seetaphal, ramphal,  pomegranate, etc. Some of these are depicted in Figure\\n14.6\\n\\nFigure 14.6: Group 4—Other vegetables & fruits.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Guides for Selecting an Adequate Diet 167167167167167\\n\\nThese vegetables and fruits supplement the minerals, vitamins, and fibre provided by Group 3 in\\noru dietary.\\n\\nServing size: One serving is a 50 g or half a katori of cut vegetable or fruit.\\nSuggested number of servings: It is suggested that you include at least three or more servings\\n\\nfrom this group each day.\\n\\nGroup 5: Oils, Fats and Sugars\\n\\nThere are two major classes of foods included in this group: oils and fats including oils, ghee,\\nbutter and vanaspati, used as a spread, seasoning or shortening and sugars. Sugar, jaggery and\\npreparations such as jams, syrups, etc., are included as sugar serving (Figure 14.7).\\n\\nFigure 14.7: Group 5: Sugars, oils and fats\\n\\nThese foods enhance the taste and acceptability of any preparation. All these foods provide\\nenergy. Sugars are a readily available energy source, while oils and fats are a concentrated energy\\nsource.\\n\\nIn contrast to sugars, which are not a good source of any essential nutrients, oils and fats have\\nother functions besides providing energy. Oils and fats are necessary to transport and utilise fat-soluble\\nvitamins in the  body. Vegetable oils contain essential fatty acids, which are necessary for growth in the\\nyoung and to maintain the health of our skin.\\n\\nServing size: A typical serving size for oils, fats and sugars is 5 g, or about a teaspoon, since we\\nuse a teaspoon to add sugar to beverages and also to serve oil or ghee.\\n\\nSuggested number of servings: Since it is not an essential component in nutritional planning,\\nthere is no recommended amount for sugar.\\n\\n\\n\\n168168168168168 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nGenerally, four to five servings a day of fats and oils is suggested. We must include about 10 g or\\ntwo servings of vegetable oil to meet our need for essential fatty acids. The remaining servings needed\\ncan be taken as ghee, butter, or vanaspati.\\n\\nThe total amount of oils and fats in the diet will vary with our total energy needs and our energy\\nintake from the other food groups. We must remember that high fat diets are harmful to our health.\\nTherefore, the ICMR Advisory Committee (RDI, 1991) suggested that the intake of dietary fat be 20\\nper cent or less of the total calorie intake for adults and 25 per cent for young children.\\n\\nIn summary, how much do we need of these foods? The answer is simple: only as much as is\\nrequired to meet our nutrient and energy needs and to make the food palatable.\\n\\nNutrient Density\\n\\nSeveral investigators are individually studying ways to develop an easy-to-use index of nutritive\\nquality of individual foods. One of these is nutrient density. It is the ratio of the percentage of the\\nrecommended  allowance of the nutrient to the percentage of the energy requirement in a serving of the\\nfood. For example, a serving of cow’s  milk (150 ml) provides 100 kcal, 180 mg calcium and 2.9 mg\\nof riboflavin. The nutrient density is calculated as given in Table 14.2.\\n\\nTable 14.2: Nutrient Density Calculation\\n\\nEnergy Calcium Riboflavin\\nKcal mg mg\\n\\nRDA (Man) 2400 400 1.40\\n\\nMilk — 1 serving 100 180 0.30\\n\\nPercentage of RDA from milk 5 45 21\\n\\nNutrient Density 9.0 4.2\\n\\nThus milk is an excellent source of calcium, as it provides 45 per cent of the RDA in one serving\\nand of riboflavin (21 per cent of RDA); while it accounts for only 5 per cent of RDA for energy. Thus\\nthe nutrient density of calcium in milk is 9.0 and riboflavin 4.2.\\n\\nPractical Aspects of Food Selection\\n\\nWhile you select foods from each food group, pay attention to the practical aspects of so that you\\nget the most nutrients for each rupee spent for food.\\n\\nIn Group 1, the cereals and breads group, the amount of iron and thiamin in the food preparations\\nvaries with how refined the grain or flour is. The chapatis made from whole wheat flour contain six\\ntimes as much thiamin as bread made from the same amount of refined wheat flour. Parboiled rice and\\nrice flakes contains more iron and thiamin than milled polished rice. This knowledge can help your\\nselection of foods from this group.\\n\\nIn the protein foods group, there is a wide choice of foods. Group 2 includes all types of dals\\nsuch as tur, chana, mung, urad, masur and whole pulses or legumes such as chawli, rajma, wal, matki,\\nchana, etc. As you may know, oilseeds such as groundnuts and til (sesame) also belong to the legume\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Guides for Selecting an Adequate Diet 169169169169169\\n\\nfamily and are included in this group. You can choose those dals and pulses, which are available at the\\nmost reasonable cost. Though all dals and legumes are good sources of B-vitamins, mung contains\\nmore thiamin than others. Groundnuts are a very rich source of niacin.\\n\\nMilk is another important part of Group 2. Milk is used in a number of preparations, such as tea,\\ncoffee, butter-milk, curds, basundi, etc. To know the total servings taken, we need to estimate the\\namount of milk used in these preparations. We may use 15 to 25 g per cup of tea, and 30 g in coffee.\\nA cup of butter-milk may contain 40 to 50 g of milk, while a cup of basundi may be made from 2.5 to\\n3 cups of milk. So you must note the amounts used in order to estimate your total milk intake.\\n\\nSimilarly, when you use eggs in a custard or pudding, you will have to note the recipe and portion\\neaten to estimate the protein intake. When you buy meat, poultry and fish, note the fatty tissue and\\nbone, and estimate the lean part per kilogramme. If you use these in a curry, record the total volume\\nand the amount served per person to estimate the protein intake.\\n\\nIn Group 3 and Group 4, the cost per serving depends to a great deal on the particular vegetables\\nand fruits selected. The edible portion of vegetables and fruits varies immensely. Estimating the edible\\nportion is important, since this affects the cost per serving.\\n\\nIn Group 3(a), leafy vegetables are sold as a bunch. The entire bunch is not edible; as tough stems\\nand damaged leaves are removed. The amount removed varies with the quality and the variety of the\\nleafy vegetable. A good quality spinach has 90 per cent edible portion while fenugreek (methi) may\\nhave only 50 per cent.\\n\\nThe edible portion of vegetables and fruits from Group 3(a) and Group 4 also varies greatly.\\nAmla, tomato, capsicum, french beans, cluster beans, beetroot, radish, etc., have a 90 to 98 per cent\\nedible portion, while peas, oranges, papaya, mango, and banana have only a 50 to 75 per cent edible\\nportion.\\n\\nFood cost: One of the questions that worries us is: will nutritious food be more costly than our\\npresent dietary? The answer to this question is an emphatic NO. We can afford nutritious food.\\n\\nVegetables and fruits are the foods, which have the greatest variation in price. Those, which are\\nin season, cost the least. The price of a particular variety is lowest at the peak of its season. What is less\\nwell known is that at the peak of the season, each vegetable and fruit has the highest nutrient\\ncontent, flavour and taste.\\n\\nThere has been extensive research in this aspect and it has been proved that the nutrient content\\nand yield of any plant food, whether it is spinach, beans, oranges or mangoes, is highest at the peak\\nof the season. When you buy seasonal foods, you buy the best in terms of quality and nutrients at a\\nreasonable price.\\n\\nAnother point to note is that inexpensive varieties are often more nutritious. Inexpensive fruits\\nsuch as amla and guava are excellent sources of vitamin C, while costly fruits such as apples and\\ngrapes are poor source of this vitamin.\\n\\nMany vegetables and fruits can be grown at home in each season. The home produce can be a\\nvaluable source of nutrition and improved quality of the diet.\\n\\nModeration is a good rule as far as the foods in Group 5 are concerned. As sugar is only a\\nsweetening agent, we would be well advised to consume it in reasonable amounts. If we take too much\\nof it, we will not have place for foods that supply varied nutrients. And although oils and fats play an\\nimportant role in the dietary, high fat diets are recognised to be harmful to our health.\\n\\n\\n\\n170170170170170 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nUse of the Food Guide in Meal Planning and Evaluation\\n\\nThe food guide is a practical tool to use in meal planning and evaluation. Please note the following\\nimportant points when using the food guide in meal planning:\\n\\n1. Select foods from each of the five broad food groups.\\n2. Choose at least the minimum number of servings from each of the food groups.\\n3. Make choices within each group. Please remember that foods in each group are similar but\\n\\nnot identical in food values.\\n4. Try to include at least one food from Group 2 in each meal.\\n5. Use seasonal vegetables and fruits to ensure good nutrition at low cost.\\n\\nThe nutritive value of menus planned, using the food guide, for an adult woman and an adult man\\nare given in Tables 14.3 and 14.4. On scrutiny of these tables, it is evident that the nutrient content of\\nthe menu is equal to or greater than the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for an adult woman\\nand man.\\n\\nTable 14.3: Nutrient Content of Menu for an Adult Woman\\n\\nFood Foods and Amount Energy Protein Vit.

For\\nexample, teenagers can take more servings from Group 1, 2 and 5 to meet the high energy requirements\\nof body building and growth.\\n\\nBesides using the food guide to plan meals, you can use it to evaluate your present dietary and to\\nmodify it, if necessary. It can also be used to check the diet plans of institutions for nutritional adequacy.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Guides for Selecting an Adequate Diet 171171171171171\\n\\nThe dietary score card is presented in Table 14.5. Five points are awarded for a serving in Groups\\n1, 2, 4 and 5, with ten points given for a serving in Group 3. The maximum scores for each food group\\nare also given.\\n\\nThis dietary score card can be used to evaluate any menu or diet plan by following the following\\nsteps:\\n\\nTable 14.4: Nutrient Content of Menu for An Adult Man\\n\\nFood Foods and Amount Energy Protein Vit.

Add the total score and evaluate as follows:\\n\\n100 Excellent\\n90 Good\\n\\nLess than 90 Need to include the missing groups.\\nYou can add more foods from all groups to the minimum servings suggested, in order to make the\\n\\nmeals satisfying. One word of caution. Be moderate in the amount of food you take from each group,\\neven if you like a particular food very much. Otherwise, you may not be able to include sufficient\\namounts of foods from all the food groups.\\n\\nAlso, snacks are an important part of meal planning. The term snack is applied to a wide variety\\nof foods, which are eaten between meals. A number of snacks are offered and eaten at tea, social\\nmeetings or get–togethers. The choice of these foods can be important in meeting one’s nutritional\\nneeds.\\n\\nPlans for Food Budget\\n\\nIn practice, one must make daily menus for a week and base the food purchase. This step is\\nessential whether the plan is for a single person, a family or an institution. The food purchase is guided\\nby nutrient needs and also the food budget. Planning helps to make the best use of the available money\\nto meet the needs of the family members.\\n\\nThe food choices within a group can be guided by one’s food budget. The steps, which help to\\nget the best returns for the food money include:\\n\\n• Buying the staple foods, dals and pulses in bulk, when the prices are competitive, just after\\nthe harvest.\\n\\n• Buying milk and milk products from government dairy outlets.\\n• Buying fruits and vegetables from main markets at competitive rates.\\n• Buying seasonal vegetables and fruits.\\n• Buy sugar, jaggery in bulk from wholesale dealers.\\n• Buy oil from wholesale depots in bulk.\\n• Make butter and ghee at home.\\n• Buy spices in bulk and prepare the spice mix at home.\\n\\nThere are several government programmes, which subsidise foods for the various socio-economic\\nstratas. These include rationed foodgrains, foods given to children in grade schools to ensure attendance,\\nschool lunch programmes and supplementary feeding of expectant and nursing mothers. These\\nprogrammes help to meet the nutritional needs. To some extent these reduce the food budget of the\\nfamily.\\n\\nNutrition Education\\n\\nNutrition education is a very important input to help people to select an adequate diet. Children\\nlearn food selection and how to select an adequate diet from their parents. It is good to remember that\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Guides for Selecting an Adequate Diet 173173173173173\\n\\nthere is a lot of good in the practices of present-day regional groups that have enjoyed good health and\\nlongevity.\\n\\nIn nutrition education, people must be encouraged to retain the existing beneficial food habits and\\nadd other foods which may help to meet their nutritional needs. Successful nutrition education reinforces\\nthe existing cultural pattern and brings about only qualitative improvement by using available food\\nresources.\\n\\nAt present nutrition is taught in limited number of faculties. It should form a part of primary\\nschool curricula. The need to prepare authentic, accurate teaching material for use in teaching at all\\nlevels can never be overemphasised. It is the responsibility of each person, who learns this subject, to\\ncontribute to this effort.\\n\\nFallacies about Foods and Nutrition\\n\\nA fallacy is a false or wrong idea. Wrong ideas about effect of food on health may be spread\\ndeliberately by those, who wish to promote their products. Food fallacies exist because of ignorance of\\nbasic scientific information about the subject. Food quacks exploit this ignorance to sell their products.\\n\\nIn each region, people have a number of beliefs. These are passed on unquestioned from one\\ngeneration to the next. It may be wise to consider those in the light of scientific knowledge. Some may\\nhave a sound basis, others not.\\n\\nSome Misconceptions about Carbohydrate in the Diet\\n\\nPotatoes are fattening. No particular food is fattening or otherwise. All energy intake in excess\\nof the body’s need is stored as fat. Potatoes provide about a kilocalorie per gram, about the same as\\ncooked rice. It is the oil, used in seasoning or frying that contributes to the extra calories of the potato\\nrecipes.\\n\\nHoney is said to contribute significant amounts of minerals and vitamins. This is not supported by\\nfacts.\\n\\nSimilarly, it is said that jaggery contributes more nutrients to the diet than white sugar. Actually it\\ndoes not, for the amount consumed in the diet is very small.\\n\\nSucrose (sugar) is injurious to health, because it is pure refined food. This not true. It is the\\ncheapest sweetener available and hence used in infant milk formulas and in medical preparations. When\\nused in moderation, it is an important source of quick energy. Used in ORS, it is life saving. It is present\\nin many foods in nature such as apples, peas, honey, oranges, etc.\\n\\nMaida is nutritionally poorer than atta (whole wheat flour). This is true.\\nWhen grains are milled and refined, the outer coat of the grain is removed. Thus the high quality\\n\\nprotein, minerals, B vitamins, all the vitamin E found in the embryo are lost. But the whole wheat flour\\nused to make chapaties, millet flours (bajra, jowar, ragi, etc.) used to make roti, contain all the nutrients\\nin the grain. It is important to know these facts.\\n\\nGeneral Fallacies\\n\\nIt is said that cooking or processing vegetables results in loss of nutritive value. It is not a correct\\nstatement. Cooking and processing improves the texture and flavour of vegetables. The loss of viamin\\nC in home cooked vegetables is only minimal (10 to 15 per cent), if the cooking water is retained.\\n\\n\\n\\n174174174174174 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIt is said that water is: “fattening”. Water has no energy value. Even if it is held in the tissues, it\\ncannot be converted into fat.\\n\\n“Natural Foods”, “Health Foods” and “Organic Foods”\\n\\nMost of the food items we buy are natural foods, as these are grown in our garden, or on a tree\\nor produced on a farm. Almost all foods are organic as they contain compounds having carbon,\\nhydrogen and oxygen. Most of the foods we eat provide the nutrients needed, so these can be called\\nhealth foods. But when these terms are used to describe some foods, the intended meaning is different.\\n\\nThus when food is called “natural food”, it contains no added chemical, such as preservative,\\nemulsifier or antioxidant.\\n\\nFood grown on soils fertilised with manure, compost or vermiculture, without addition of any\\nchemical as fertiliser, pesticide or herbicide are called “organic foods”. These are generally more expensive\\nthan those produced otherwise. But scientific study to evaluate the difference in major nutrient content\\nhas shown none. A few minor variations occur indicating that the use of chemical fertilisers can help\\nintroduce trace elements as needed but organic fertilisers cannot. Thus there is no advantage due to the\\nuse of organic fertilisers.\\n\\nA food labelled as “Health food” implies that it must have some health-giving attributes, which\\nother foods do not have. This is not the case. Hence the use of the term “Health Foods” is inaccurate.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. What are the factors which you should consider for developing a food guide?\\n2. List the five groups into which foods can be divided.\\n3. Define a balanced diet.\\n4. List the foods you include in your daily meals. Check and see if you use the amounts of food\\n\\nindicated in the daily food guide. If you don’t list the foods that are missing or present in\\nsmaller amounts.\\n\\n5. List the steps to be taken to conserve the food budget.\\n6. Why is nutrition education important?\\n7. Write short notes on:\\n\\n• Food fallacies.\\n• Misconceptions about carbohydrate foods.\\n• Organic foods.\\n\\n\\n\\nCCCCCHAPTERHAPTERHAPTERHAPTERHAPTER 15 15 15 15 15\\n\\nMeal Planning for the Family\\n\\nMeal Planning\\n\\nObjectives in Meal Planning\\n\\nNutritional Adequacy\\n\\nFood Costs\\nEnergy Foods\\nProtein Foods\\nVegetables and Fruits\\n\\nFactors Affecting Food Selection\\nFood Acceptance\\nTradition\\nFood Misinformation\\n\\nOther Aspects Affecting Food Selection\\nVariety\\n\\nAvailability of Foods\\nHome Production\\n\\nSchedules of Family Members\\n\\nTime\\n\\nFamily Size and Composition\\n\\nPlanning Process in Brief\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n“I never knew a man who did not like a kitchen fire,\\nNor a woman, if she be away awhile, but would tire\\n\\nOf inns and servants and would long to be\\nBack in her own kitchen, buttering toast and making tea.”\\n\\n(Grace Nell  Crowell ‘Kitchen’ from White Fire, the South\\nWest Press, by permission of Mrs. Crowell and The Turner Company, Dallas, Texas)\\n\\n\\n\\n176176176176176 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nMEAL PLANNING involves deciding what to eat day at each meal. It takes thought, effort and\\nuse of knowledge acquired in the earlier chapters. As the family’s well-being and health are dependent\\non how well they are fed, it is a challenge to every meal manager to meet it. It proves to be a satisfying\\nand rewarding experience, when done well.\\n\\nEach day we eat three meals and perhaps an additional snack. The various members of the family\\npartake of these meals. We need to plan the meals to ensure that the needs of each family member are\\nmet. The plan can be flexible to take advantage of lower prices of seasonal foods, and to meet the needs\\nand choices of your family. But it has to be a plan. Meal planning can be done by the family as a joint\\nproject. The family members can discuss the meal plans, the food budget and the actual preparation\\nand help in making the plans work. Such co-operation will lead to greater acceptance and enjoyment of\\nthe meals. In Figure 15.1, the four steps involved in meat planning are pictorially depicted.\\n\\nFigure 15.1: The family’s meals — planning, purchasing, preparing and serving.\\n\\nMeal Planning\\n\\nYou must take into account the family members, their ages and occupation in planning family\\nmeals. The food guide presented in Figure 15.2 will help in selecting foods. This will help you to decide\\nthe amounts of foods needed from each group. As you learnt earlier, there is a large variety in the kinds\\nof foods within each food group, so it is possible to choose foods, which the family members like from\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nPurchasing\\n\\nPreparation\\n\\nServing\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for the Family 177177177177177\\n\\neach group. It is important to use seasonal vegetables and fruits, as these are not only of high quality,\\nbut are available at reasonable price.\\n\\nThe selection will also be guided by the schedules of the family members. All that you eat and\\ndrink at home or outside, the cup of tea/coffee taken daily, the snaks served at meetings, the chana-\\ndana, which children eat in short recess, all form part of the daily food intake of the members. Planning\\nfor these or at least an awareness of these, makes it easier for you to pick the foods that add up to meet\\nthe needs of various family members.\\n\\nMeal planning is intimately connected with food purchase. In purchasing food, consider the\\nspace available for storage and the conditions of storage. For example, if the space is limited, you may\\nhave to purchase food often. If you have a refrigerator, you can buy vegetables and fruits once a week.\\nThus now often you purchase foods is dependent on the space and conditions of storage.\\n\\nObjectives in Meal Planning\\n\\nIn planning meals your aim is:\\n1. to satisfy the nutritional needs of the family members, according to their age and occupation.\\n2. keep expenditure within your family’s food budget.\\n3. to decide amounts of foods to be purchased from each food group.\\n4. to consider family size and composition.\\n5. To consider food storage space and conditions of storage, to decide how often you need to\\n\\npurchase various foods.\\nIn order to translate the meal plan into meals that meet the family’s needs, the following additional\\n\\nsteps have to be taken —\\n6. Prepare a food purchase list, taking the food preferences of members into account.\\n7. Use methods of preparation, which retain nutrients, without sacrificing palatability.\\n8. Serve meals, which are appetising and attractive and fit in the schedule of the members.\\n9. Manage the time, energy and available materials efficiently, with the help of the family\\n\\nmembers.\\nIf you make a weekly plan for all meals, you can save time, energy and money. It will also help\\n\\nyou to avoid monotonous meals.\\n\\nNutritional Adequacy\\n\\nThe first prerequisite of a good meal plan is that it should meet the nutritional needs of the whole\\nfamily. This objective can be achieved by selecting foods according to the daily food guide (Figure\\n15.2). Thus each meal must include:\\n\\nCereals and their products To provide energy and proteins.\\n\\nDals, milk, egg, fish or meat To supply proteins, B-vitamins and some minerals.\\n\\nProtective vegetables and fruits To provide vitamins A & C, minerals and fibre.\\n\\nSugars, oils and fats To provide  energy, satiety and improve palatability.\\n\\n\\n\\n178178178178178 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 15.2: A daily food guide.\\n\\nIf you include the suggested number of units from each group, you can be reasonably assured of\\nmeeting needs for protein, vitamins and minerals. The variety chosen within a group will be determined\\nby the taste preferences of the family members.\\n\\nSpecific requirements for various periods of the life-cycle are made in the recommended dietary\\nintakes. These can easily be fulfilled by using more units from the food groups, which provide these\\n\\n1. Cereals and Breads\\n\\n2.

For example, a teenager may need six units from group two to meet his protein needs for\\ngrowth and maintenance, but an adult may need only three. An older person may be served the carrot\\nsalad in grated form, while other members may be served carrot sticks; salads may be made without oil\\nseasoning for an overweight member, while others can have their salad seasoned. These are some of\\nthe practical ways to suit the family meals to the nutritional needs of individual family members.\\n\\nFood is a basic necessity of life. It is important that sufficient part of the monetary resources are\\nset aside to meet the food needs of the family. If the allowance for food is low, there is a greater need\\nto plan meals carefully and to get the right foods to ensure nutritional adequacy for each member of the\\nfamily.\\n\\nFood Costs\\n\\nYou must remember that the price of food is not related to its nutritional contribution to the diet;\\nit is ruled by the law of demand and supply. The economics of food consumption is a broad subject,\\nbut it is important to plan meals and buy food wisely so that maximum benefit is derived from the\\nmoney spent. First of all you must decide the total amount of money you can spend for food purchase.\\nThen you can select foods, which can be bought with the available money. Let us consider the economic\\nsources of various nutrients.\\n\\nEnergy Foods: In Table 15.1 you can find the comparative cost of 100 calorie portion of various\\nfoods. As you may observe, grains as well as starchy roofs are economical sources of food energy.\\nGrains supply proteins in addition to energy.\\n\\nFats, oils, sugar and jaggery, which are used to make food palatable, are also sources of energy,\\nbut these are expensive. Butter, ghee and vanaspati are good sources of Vitamin A.\\n\\nProtein Foods: Table 15.2, the cost of supplying five grammes of protein from various foods is\\nindicated. As you can see dals, whole beans and peas are the cheapest protein foods. Dehydrated fish\\nmay be another inexpensive source. If you live near a river or the sea, fresh fish may be available at\\ncompetitive cost. Less expensive cuts of meat also can be used as protein. In the rural areas, eggs and\\npoultry is produced at home by some, thus ensuring economy.\\n\\nTable 15.1: Comparative Cost of Energy-supplying Foods\\n\\nFood Cost/kg or liter1 Quantity supplying Cost of 100 Kcal\\n(rupees) 100 Kcal (paise)\\n\\nWheat 2.75 30g 8\\nRice 4.50 30g 14\\nJowar, Ragi, Makka 2.50 30g 7\\nDal, Pulse (whole) 8.00–12.00 30g 24–36\\nSugar 5.00 25 g 12\\nOil 22.00 11g 24\\nVanaspati 25.00 11g 28\\nButter 50.00 13g 65\\nGhee 65.00 11g 71\\nMilk 5.25 150g 79\\nEggs 7.20/dozen 1.4 eggs 83\\n\\n1.

Milk is an\\nimportant source of protein, though an expensive one. Some milk is needed at every stage of life.\\n\\nVegetables and Fruits: Vegetables and fruits are important sources of minerals and vitamins.\\nGreen leafy vegetables are a rich source of the vitamins, provitamin A, vitamin C, and the minerals\\ncalcium and iron. The fruits amla, guavas, citrus fruits, pineapple and tomatoes are a good source of\\nvitamin C. Some vegetables and fruits are seasonal, while others are available throughout the year at a\\ncompetitive cost. Various greens are available throughout the year at very little cost. Vegetables and\\nfruits at the peak of the season are not only inexpensive, but are of high quality in terms of acceptability\\nand nutrient content. Tables 15.3 and 15.4 give the cost of supplying a fourth of day’s need for\\nprovitamin A and vitamin C from various vegetables and fruits.\\n\\nTable 15.3: Comparative Cost of Vitamin A Foods\\n\\nFood Source Cost/100 g1  To provide 1/4 RDI2\\n\\n(paise) Amount Cost in Paise\\n\\nVegetables and Fruits—green and yellow\\nAmaranth, Radish tops, Spinach, etc. 50 8–15 g 4–8\\nCabbage 25 62 g 15\\nCarrots 30 40 g 12\\nOrange 50 66 g 33\\nMango 80 27 g 22\\n\\nFats\\nVanaspati 250 25 g 62\\nButter 500 20 g 100\\nGhee 650 18 g 117\\n\\nAnimal foods\\nMilk 53 375 g 199\\nEggs 120 37 g 4S\\nLiver 200 3 g 6\\n\\n1.

With a little planning, they can produce the dals, vegetables\\nand fruits also for home consumption, so that the quality of their diets may improve.\\n\\nIn estimating food cost, it is good to note that a number of non-food items are purchased at the\\nfood store, for example, toilet soap, hair oil, cleaning agents and equipment. These may appear on the\\nbill, and must be subtracted from the total to get a correct idea about money spent for food. But the\\nmoney spent for snacks at work or in the school must be added to the food costs of the family.\\n\\nFactors Affecting Food Selection\\n\\nFood Acceptance: Each one of us has certain foods we like; certain foods we do not like. But\\nfood tastes can be cultivated. As we move from one place to another, we can enlarge our acquaintance\\nof foods, by trying the foods of that place. It helps us to enjoy our new environment. Learning new\\nways of using availables foods is another way of bringing variety in meal planning.\\n\\nTradition: Most of our food selection is influenced by tradition, be it national, regional or family\\ntraditions. A lot of traditional selection is based on experience, but sometimes some poor practices\\nbecome part of a traditon and must be dispensed with.\\n\\nTable 15.4: Comparative Cost of Vitamin C Foods1\\n\\nFood Source Cost/100 g  To provide 1/4 RDI3\\n\\n EP2 (paise) Amount Cost in Paise\\nAmla 50 2 g 1\\nGuava 50 6 g 3\\nDrumstick Leaves4 50 15 g 8\\nCoriander leaves4 50 22 g 11\\nCabbage4 25 22 g 6\\nRadish tops4 75 30 g 23\\nCapsicum4 50 22 g 11\\nKnol-khol/bittergourd4 50 30 g 6\\nDrumsticks4 100 22 g 22\\nCauliflower4 50 45 g 23\\nBanana 62 60 g 37\\nMausambi 80 25 g 20\\nOrange 50 40 g 20\\nTomato 30 50 g 15\\n\\n1.

You see and hear about it in advertisements too. Some of this information\\nmay be useful, but a large part  may not be. False ideas about food are common, as also wrong\\ninformation. But many of these originate in ignorance. But as you learn about food composition you\\nwill be able to use this knowledge to guide food selection. It is your duty to spread the knowledge\\ngained to others so that they discard false ideas about food, which interfere with their food acceptance\\nand health.\\n\\nOther Factors Affecting Meal Planning—Skill in Food. Preparation: Skill in food preparation\\nis an essential part of an acceptable, enticing meal. Skill in food preparation is acquired by practice.\\nIngenious combinations improve acceptability of foods, add to variety and thus make food enjoyable.\\nFor example, some dark green leafy vegetables have strong flavour, which can be diluted by addition of\\nother, milder foods, or modified by addition of other ingredients. Methi leaves are bitter, if ground dal\\nor besan is added to it the bitter flavour is diluted and the mild flavour of the product is enjoyable;\\nsimilarly addition of grated coconut or jaggery also makes the flavour of the finished vegetable acceptable.\\nIt is this skill that makes the flavour of the finished vegetable acceptable. It is this skill that makes a hot\\nsoup at home more appetising than a meal at a first class restaurant. One can develop skill by observing\\npeople who perform well and by practice. It is important to try and perfect the skills acquired, until it\\nbecomes a habit.\\n\\nVariety: The enjoyment of food can be enhanced by learning ways to prepare dishes from other\\nregions of India and foreign countries. If a new dish prepared once a week, the monotony in meals is\\navoided.\\n\\nAvailability of Foods\\n\\nIt is important to study the seasonal variation in availability of foods. In each season one can find\\nsome foods from each group. Using seasonal foods reduces cost. Some vegetables and fruits can be\\ngrown in the kitchen garden. Some foods like beans, rice, wheat can be purchased soon after the time\\nof harvest, when the price is reasonable, and stored for the whole year.\\n\\nHome Production: If some of the vegetables and fruits are grown at home, these need to be used\\nin meal planning. Some of the fresh condiments such as coriander leaves, curry leaves, green chillies,\\nmint and different leafy vegetables can easily be grown at home.\\n\\nIn rural areas where most of the staples are produced at home, meal planning helps to decide\\nrealistically the amount of food the family should retain for home use, so that the needs of the family\\nare met. It also helps to decide what vegetables and fruits can be grown economically to improve the\\nfamily’s meal pattern, without adding to the food cost. When fruits and vegetables are produced in\\nexcess of the family needs, the surplus can be sold.\\n\\nSchedules of Family Members: When planning a meal pattern, one needs to think of the schedules\\n(time-table) of the family members,—meal times and the number of meals eaten at home and those that\\nare eaten away from home. If packed lunches are made for the man of the house and children at\\nschool, the menus need to be modified to ensure that the items can be packed and the menu is appetising\\neven when cold.\\n\\nTime available for meal preparation and the help available, in food preparation, be it from children\\nor hired help, may affect the choice of foods bought and the menu.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for the Family 183183183183183\\n\\nFamily Size and Composition\\n\\nThe family size affects the foods that can be served. It is known that the money spent for food\\nper person decreases as the family size increases, when the family income remains constant. Such is\\nthe case when there are several closely spaced children in the family. As the money available to the\\nfamily does not change with the size of family, a larger part of it has to be spent to meet the food needs.\\nStaples such as wheat, rice, jowar are bought in larger amounts, but the amount of milk, vegetables,\\nfruits bought may decrease. Thus the quality of the diet is lowered. In extreme cases, it may not be\\npossible to meet the food needs of the family members resulting in partial starvation. As this happens to\\na large number of families, which migrate to cities in hope of improved living conditions, it is important\\nto emphasise the relation of family size to family’s food intake and health and promote small family\\nnorms, in the interest of better health and survival. Table 15.5 indicates the availability of milk as related\\nto the per capita income.\\n\\nFamily composition affects the kinds and amounts of food needed and the pattern of meals\\nserved. For example, when children are below five years of age, more milk is needed, the number of\\nmeals are more, as the child cannot take large amounts at a time. As the child grows the meal pattern\\nchanges to accommodate the school hours and the need to pack lunch or snack may arise.\\n\\nAdolescents in the family need more food than adults, as they need large quantities of food to\\nsupport growth and their activities. The food needs of the adult members will depend on how active\\nthey are. Older members of the family need lesser amounts of food, but may need change in consistency,\\ndue to faulty teeth or lack of teeth.\\n\\nAs festivals call for special menus, it is important to note these in making the food list.\\n\\nTable 15.5: Income and Milk Purchased per Head\\n\\nPer capita monthly income Milk purchased\\n(in rupees) (ml. per head per day)\\n\\n< 100 245\\n\\n101–160 316\\n\\n161–240 377\\n\\n241–400 441\\n\\n> 401 618\\n\\nPlanning Process in Brief\\n\\nIt is necessary to plan on a monthly basis. There are five main steps in meal planning:\\n1. Make a list of foods from each food group, that are available in the market.\\n2. Check the prices and decide which of the foods from each group fit in the food budget on\\n\\nthe basis of the number of family members.\\n3. Estimate the day’s needs for all the family-members on the basis of the Daily Food Guide\\n\\nand calculate the month’s food needs from it.\\n4. Make a list of foods to be purchased monthly, fortnightly, weekly and daily.\\n\\n\\n\\n184184184184184 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n5. Plan menus to meet the daily needs of the family.\\nIt is possible that some changes have to be made towards the end of the week to use up foods,\\n\\nwhich may not keep. Sometimes an additional guest may result in change of menu.\\nIf the homemaker must prepare food, the plan should be made with economy of time and energy\\n\\nin view. Making a food list ahead of time helps in conserving shopping time. Some dishes may be made\\nahead of time, e.g., making halwa or laddu the day before the party. The plan must be related to\\nfacilities available for food preparation. Some amount of standardisation occurs in the meal plans of\\neach family, which helps in efficient management of meals.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. List the objectives in planning meals. How can you ensure nutritional adequacy in meals?\\n2. Discuss how to meet the nutritional needs at minimum food costs.\\n3. What are the non-nutritional factors, which affect meal planning?

It was mentioned that the needs of\\nindividuals family members must be considered in estimating the food needs of the family. As the\\nfamily consists of various age groups in various physiological states, let us consider the needs of each\\nstage of life, starting with adulthood.\\n\\nAdulthood\\n\\nAdulthood represents the steady state in life, when a person would have completed his/her growth\\nin terms of body size. The nutritional needs are for maintenance of body functions. The energy needs\\nin adulthood are mainly to sustain body functions and activity. The protein requirement is to be made\\ngood the wear and tear and the losses, which occur as a result of normal life processes. Thus adult\\nstage is taken as a norm and requirements in other stages are discussed in relation to it.\\n\\nAdulthood also represents the productive stage of life. Therefore, it is important that the nutritional\\nneeds of an adult be met adequately, so as to keep up vitality and a positive attitude in life, which are\\nessential for optimum productivity.\\n\\nChanging Food Habits: Each of us have foods, which are our favourites. These are served on\\nspecial occasions such as birthday, parties or other celebrations. Though one should take the likes and\\ndislikes of family members into account in meal planning, we should not allow our preferences to rule\\nour diets. Allowing people to develop a restricted food pattern may lead to a poorly balanced diet and\\ncould be a social disadvantage. Trying to like new foods enlarges one’s food enjoyment, social experience\\nas well as diet.\\n\\nFood Selection: The selection of foods is made according to the daily food guide. The amounts\\nof foods included from the various groups will depend on the body size and activity of the individual.\\nThus a labourer, who is very active may need more cereals and oils and fat to meet his/her energy\\nneeds as compared to a sedentary person, who is involved in desk work. The foods selected need to be\\nused in the day’s meals, which fit into the daily schedule of the person.\\n\\nBreakfast an Important Meal: The first meal in the day is important as about 12 hours elapse\\nbetween dinner and breakfast. About one-fourth to one third of the day’s food should be taken for\\nbreakfast. Rural agricultural families normally have a hearty breakfast. But in the cities the pattern\\nvaries from region to region. Some regions have a certain definite pattern of breakfast and some\\npreparations are clearly associated with breakfast, e.g., idli-chatni, upma are considered as breakfast\\nfoods in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, roasted ragi flour and milk, in Mysore, dahi-pohe, doodh-pohe in\\nwestern Maharashtra, paranthe and lassi in Punjab, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 187187187187187\\n\\nIn many urban families, it is customary to eat the fluid and soft dishes (such as rice, dal,  dahi,\\nsalads, etc.) in the meal at about 8.30 to 9 a.m. and pack and carry other items of the meal (such as\\nchapati, bread and butter, sandwiches, vegetables, chole, usal, pickle, etc.) in a lunch pack to work.\\nThus in the cities, whatever food is eaten before leaving home for work constitutes a breakfast. It\\nusually consists of a cereal preparation, dal/fish/meat preparation, and curd/butter  milk/milk, vegetables,\\netc.\\n\\nMany persons, especially housewives and girls omit breakfast to reduce their food intake. But it\\nis known that a person, who eats a good breakfast, performs better at work and is likely to eat less\\nduring the day. A person who skips breakfast has a tendency to take snacks or eat more at lunch and\\ndinner, thus increasing the total food intake. Protein content of snacks is usually low and the satiety\\nvalue is also low. Further comparative studies have shown that those who have good breakfasts have\\na greater work output and are more alert.\\n\\nAs many people in the cities and villages have to carry packed lunch, or select one from a limited\\nmenu in snack counters, it is very important to plan breakfast to supply foods, which are sufficient\\nboth in quality and quantity.\\n\\nLunch Often a Poor Meal: About one-third of day’s food intake should be contributed by lunch\\nor the noon meal. Lunch should be counted as a part of food plan for the day, and not just a snack to\\nstave off hunger till dinner time.\\n\\nA good lunch should provide protein and protective foods, not just starchy foods. A common\\neating pattern of many office workers is to have any available snack such as samosa, batata-vada,\\npakodas, etc., or bread and butter and tea at the office canteen or at a cafe nearby. This is sometimes\\nimproved when milk or a milk product like lassi, cold milk drink is taken instead of tea. Too often the\\nlunch pack from home may consist of chapati, bread and butter or puri-jam, chapati-pickle or chutney,\\nor potato bhaji, which are accompanied by a cup of tea/coffee. While these foods may be more filling\\nthan the snack bought at work, they meet energy needs, without supplying much protein and protective\\nfoods. It is important to include a serving of protein foods at lunch. Selection  of vegetables or fruit\\nmay help meet part of the need for protective foods.\\n\\nLunch, whether served at home or packed and carried to work, or purchased at the place of\\nwork, should be planned or chosen with care. A missed meal is not easily made up. Consistent neglect\\nof this important meal may affect the individual’s performance at work, behaviour with colleagues and\\nattitude to life adversely.\\n\\nThe lunch should be planned in relation to the other needs, so that it supplies a fair share of the\\nday’s nutrients through the foods selected. A suggested daily food plan for the three meals is given in\\nTable 16.1.\\n\\nDinner: This is the main meal of the day, which may be served at noon or night, depending on\\nthe family’s schedule or custom. It is good to plan a menu for dinner which helps to balance the total\\nintake in terms of energy, protein as well as other nutrients for the day. One may prepare an additional\\nvegetable and salad, one may also add a dessert or sweet, to add to the variety. The active members\\nmay eat more heartily of the cereal dishes, while the person who has to watch his weight may eat more\\nof salads and vegetables. As this is a leisurely meal, which is eaten by the family together, it contributes\\nmuch to the feeling of belonging, enjoyment of the company and relaxation.\\n\\nSnacks: It has become an accepted practice in most offices and factories for workers to have a\\ntea break. Most of the canteens and cafes, which serve tea and coffee, also serve snacks, most of\\nwhich are shallow or deep fat fried preparations. Thus the tea break provides an opportunity to eat as\\n\\n\\n\\n188188188188188 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nwell as drink. The choice of the snack may decide if it will provide only energy or energy plus other\\nnutrients. Dishes such as batata-vada, vegetable patties, pakodas may contribute little but calories, and\\nmay dull the appetite, while dahi-vada, idli-sambhar, misal, sweetened milk, lassi, icecream, chana-\\ndana, fruits, may provide some nutrients in addition to energy.\\n\\nIt is not possible and desirable to make rigid rules about between meals eating. It may be wise to\\nchoose such snacks as add to the nutrient intake, especially when these are intended to meet wholly or\\npartly the need for a meal. Some suggestions for these snacks are milk or milk beverages, cereal-dal or\\ndal-milk or cereal-milk mixed dishes, salads and fruits.\\n\\nTable 16.1: Food Plan for a Day.\\n\\nThe daily food plan Sample menu\\n\\nMilk (2 servings) Breakfast\\nDal (2 servings) Shira/upma, milk, banana, tea\\nVegetables (3 servings)\\nFruit (1 serving) Lunch\\nCereals (10 servings) Rice, chapati, dal, vegetable beans,\\nSugar carrot and cabbage mixed salad,\\nOil, fat dahi/lassi\\nBreakfast Tea\\n\\nCereal and milk, fruit Tea, bread and butter\\nLunch Dinner\\n\\nCereals, dal, two vegetables, dahi Rice, roti, dal, leafy vegetables, dahi\\nDinner\\n\\nCereals, dal, leafy vegetables, dahi.\\n\\nNutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation\\n\\nPregnancy and lactation are two stages of life when an adult women’s needs are increased. She\\nhas the responsibility of supporting the growth of the foetus internally during the nine months of\\npregnancy and later externally by nursing the infant. Since the growth needs at the commencement of\\nlife are crucial, good nutrition is a must for the expectant as well as nursing mother. A number of\\ntissues are formed to protect and sustain the foetus. During pregnancy the mother has to meet her own\\nneeds and the needs of the growing foetus. There is additional need for the growth of other related\\ntissues and to build-up fat stores to cushion the foetus, prior to birth, and to supply part of the energy\\nneeded for milk formation during lactation. Thus the need for all nutrients involved in tissue synthesis\\nis increased during pregnancy (Figure 16.1).\\n\\nAdolescent mothers, who have not completed their own growth, may need additional foods to\\nmeet their own growth requirements. If these are not met, their health may be affected, which may\\nindirectly affect the welfare of the foetus. If the mother’s diet has been adequate before pregnancy, she\\nmay be in a better position to meet the demands of pregnancy.\\n\\nNo mother would like to injure the health of her baby through poor food habits. However, nutritional\\nstudies have shown that many women attend to the needs of other family members at the expense of\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 189189189189189\\n\\ntheir own needs. The situation does not change during pregnancy. Thus pregnant women are often the\\nmost poorly fed members of the family. In her effort to take care of others, she does not take time to\\nsit down and eat. When she is very tired she is unable to eat. If the food supply is limited, she is the\\nworst affected, as she feeds all other members and eats what is left. It is important that the family\\nshould plan the arrival of the baby so that the pregnant mother does not suffer from lack of food both\\nin terms of amount and kind. The expectant father must try to ensure that the expectant mother gets\\nthe right amounts and kinds of foods, so that the health of the foetus does not suffer.\\n\\nEnergy Needs\\n\\nThe Advisory Committee of the Indian Council for Medical Research recommends an increase of\\n300 calories per day in the latter half of pregnancy. As growth of the foetus is very rapid in the second\\nhalf of pregnancy, it is important that the increased need for energy is met.\\n\\nEnough energy food should be supplied to ensure that the dietary protein is used for building new\\ntissues, and not to meet need for energy. During first part of pregnancy the demand for extra energy is\\nsmall and is taken care of by the reduced activity.\\n\\nFigure 16.1: Energy and protein needs vary with age, occupation and physiological stage.\\n\\nIf the mother is within a few kilogrammes of the ideal weight for her body build, a gradual weight\\ngain of up to 9-10 kg appears to be desirable. Under weight mothers may be encouraged to gain more\\nweight, while those gaining too much weight may be advised to restrict their weight gain during\\npregnancy. Exact factual data about the most desirable weight gain and the significance of different\\nrates of gain is not available.\\n\\nThe additional energy is used for building of new tissues, which is evident from the higher basal\\nmetabolic rate accompanying it, and also for the movement and activities of the larger body in the later\\npart of pregnancy.\\n\\nProtein Needs\\nAdditional protein is necessary for growth of the foetus, new maternal tissues and to prepare the\\n\\nmother for lactation. The ICMR recommends 14 g of protein daily during the second half of pregnancy.\\n\\nAge – 7-8 months\\nCalories – 865\\nProtein – 14g\\nBody Weight – 8 kg\\n\\n9 years\\n2050\\n36 g\\n25 kg\\n\\n25 years Sedentary\\n1900\\n45 g\\n45 kg\\n\\nPregnant\\n2200\\n59 g\\n55 kg\\n\\nModerate Activity\\n2200\\n45 g\\n45 kg\\n\\n\\n\\n190190190190190 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThe protein should be of good quality, e.g., milk, eggs, fish, meat, etc. Good quality may be\\nachieved by combining sources of protein in the diet. Some of it could be supplied by milk and milk\\nproducts.\\n\\nMineral Needs\\n\\nThe need for minerals, which form a part of body structure is increased with pregnancy. Calcium\\nand phosphorus are needed for formation of bones and teeth. The teeth formation starts early in\\nprenatal life, so it is important that the mother gets sufficient calcium from the beginning of pregnancy.\\n\\nIron is needed for the synthesis of additional volume of blood and other tissues formed during\\ndevelopment of the foetus. The store of iron is built in prenatal period, because milk, the infant’s main\\nfood during first three to four months after birth, is deficient in iron. It is now a common practice for\\nthe doctor to give expectant mothers a prescription for an iron salt. Though this is true, foods rich in\\niron should be emphasised in the diet. The mother will need to continue to eat a diet high in iron after\\ndelivery also, to make up for some of the losses at the time of childbirth. A number of foods traditionally\\nprepared for feeding a nursing mother in the early part of lactation are rich in iron.\\n\\nIodine: There is an additional need for iodine at this stage in life. If mother’s iodine intake is low,\\nthe infant may suffer from cretenism, a disease which is characterised by retarded physical and mental\\ndevelopment. The iodine deficiency disease in adults is simple goitre.\\n\\nIn areas where the soil and water are deficient in iodine, the use of iodised salt is recommended.\\nCraving for Certain Foods: This may be due to psychological need for attention. It may be\\n\\nsatisfied, if these do not conflict with the meeting of nutritional needs.\\nNausea and vomiting  may be common in early part of the pregnancy. A high carbohydrate diet,\\n\\nconsisting of bland preparations, given as small frequent feedings, is likely to be beneficial. It is advisable\\nto avoid strong flavours, e.g., strong coffee or tea, spicy and oily foods.\\n\\nConstipation: Constipation is one of the complaints in pregnancy, because the enlarged uterus\\nmay press against the intestines and prevent normal movement. There is a tendency to decrease or\\nminimise physical activity. This is not advisable, as exercise not only helps elimination but also keeps\\nthe body fit. Generally, some of the aids to regular elimination, which help in all stages of life, may be\\npractised everyday to maintain good health in pregnancy. These are:\\n\\n1. Drink more water. A glass or two taken before breakfast are often helpful. Some people find\\nwarm water more helpful than cold.\\n\\n2. Eat the right foods. Include plenty of vegetables and fruits, especially green leafy vegetables,\\nfresh fruits, raw salads, whole-grain preparations.\\n\\n3. Eat at regular hours. Eat slowly.\\n4. Take some exercise daily to help movement, improve breathing and help the body to relax. A\\n\\nnumber of exercises can be performed regularly. Walking is a good and easy exercise.\\n5. Develop regular toilet habit. Early in the morning or, after the first cup of tea is a good time\\n\\nfor a bowel movement.\\n\\nMeeting the Dietary Needs of the Nursing Mother\\n\\nIt is recommended that the diet of a nursing mother should supply 700 calories in addition to her\\nnormal needs. This helps her to meet the demands of extra energy for lactation. Additional protein and\\nother nutrients are also needed. The additional amounts recommended are indicated in the list. The\\nincrease in requirements is related to the amount of milk produced (Table 16.2).\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 191191191191191\\n\\nIntake of high quality protein helps in improved secretion of milk. The intake of minerals, calcium,\\nphosphorus, iron, iodine and vitamins, A, D, B-complex and C should be increased during lactation.\\n\\nTable 16.2: Additional Amounts of Nutrients Recommended During Lactation\\n\\nNutrient Additional amount recommended\\n\\nEnergy 700 kcal\\nProtein 20 g\\nCalcium 600 mg\\nIron nil\\nVitamin A 400 mcg retinol or 1600 mcg beta-carotene\\nThiamin 0.3 mg\\nRiboflavin 0.4 mg\\nNiacin 5.0 mg\\n\\nVitamin C 40 mg\\n\\nTable 16.3:  Additional Foods for Nursing Mother\\n\\nFoods Amount Calories Protein\\n\\nPlan 1\\nWheat, jowar, bajra or ragi 90 g 305 8–11g\\nDal, pulse, milk, fish or egg 1 S 100 5–6g\\nGarden cress seeds (haliv) 20 g 90 5\\nLeafy or orange yellow vegetable/fruit 50 g 25 2\\nOil, any fat, butter or ghee 20 g 180 —\\n\\nTotal intake 700 20–24\\n\\nPlan 2\\nCereals 75 to 100 g 260–340 5–10\\nDal/Pulse 20–25 g 85–100 5–6\\nMilk 1C 120 6\\nGarden cress seeds 10g 45 2\\nAmaranth or any dark green leafy veg. 75 g 35 3\\nOil, fat 10–20 g 90–180 —\\n\\nTotal intake 635–715 21–27\\n\\nModification of Normal Diet.

In most regions, it is customary to feed the nursing mother additional amount of fat (ghee)\\nwhich supplies energy and vitamin A or some special preparations (Lahia, laddus of methi, mung,\\ngarden cress seeds), which contain sources of protein, iron, calcium and vitamins B. It is advisable to\\nanalyse the nutritional contribution of such products, so that one can emphasise those, which help to\\nmeet the additional need for nutrients (Table 16.3).\\n\\n\\n\\n192192192192192 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFactors Involved in Milk Secretion\\n\\nBesides optimal diet others factors affect milk production. The mother’s desire to feet the baby is\\na very important factor. A mother, who subconsciously thinks of nursing as an imposition on her\\npersonal freedom, or something which may affect her figure adversely, may not be able to nurse her\\nbaby. Her subconscious reaction may affect secretion of milk adversely. It may not be inopportune to\\nmention that these fears are baseless. Normal lactation helps the mother to regain her natural figure\\neffortlessly. A mother, who does not nurse her baby, may need to exercise more vigilance to avoid\\nlosing her figure, than a mother, who is able to nurse her baby.\\n\\nA calm, quiet life favours maximal secretion of milk. Fear, worry, grief, anxiety, excitement,\\nanger, tend to retard milk secretion. While moderate exercise helps milk secretion, excessive exercise\\ndepresses it. A comfortable seat, a calm atmosphere, freedom from pre-occupations and quiet are\\nessential during nursing a baby. It is important for the nursing mother to have a happy family, which\\ngives her emotional support during this stage of life, which is physically and psychologically very\\ndemanding and imposes restrictions on her personal freedom. This was well appreciated by our\\nforefathers. The custom of sending an expectant mother to her parents and her stay with them for\\nthree to six months after delivery, used to ensure pleasant atmosphere for the mother and child.\\n\\nNutrition During Infancy\\n\\nProper feeding of infants is necessary to ensure normal growth and development. Infancy is the\\nperiod of most rapid growth when one considers the period from birth to adulthood. The foundations\\nof future health is laid during the first year of life. Breast milk is the first normal food for the baby. It\\nprovides the nutrients needed in a proportion suited to the infants rapid growth needs. This is a period\\nin which the capacity of the stomach of the infant and ability to digest various foods components\\nchanges rapidly (Figure 16.2). Therefore, breast feeding is thought to be very important during this\\nperiod. Each child grows according to his/her potential and individual progress is noted to record\\ngrowth and development.\\n\\nNutrient Requirements\\n\\nThe need for energy is highest per unit of body-weight in the first year of life, as compared to the\\nsubsequent years of growth up to adulthood. The high energy needs in due to high basal metabolic rate,\\nthe energy requirement for growth and activity. The energy need decreases from second year to\\nadulthood. The energy need for activity is very much variable, with an active infant using 40 per cent\\nof the total energy and quiet babies using only 15 per cent of the total energy for activity.\\n\\nThe Indian Council of Medical Research recommends that calorie allowance for 1–6 months be\\n118 cal per kg and 7–12 months 108 cal per kg. When these energy needs are compared with those of\\nan average young adult, which are from 40–50 calories per kg body-weight, the high energy needs of\\nan infant beome apparent. The relatively high need for energy of an infant is understandable, when we\\nnote that an average infant doubless his birth weight in the first five months of life and trebles it by the\\nend of the first year.\\n\\nSatisfactory weight gain is one of the simple indications of successful feeding of the baby.\\nAs the body growth is rapid, it is accompanied by building of large amounts of body tissues. It is\\n\\nnecessary to provide protein of  high quality to sustain this rapid building process. As the body growth\\nincludes the building of strong bones and teeth, the infant’s need for the minerals, calcium and phosphorus\\nis high. Breast milk or Cow’s milk supply these minerals in sufficient amounts, if an adequate quantity\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 193193193193193\\n\\nis taken daily. As the infant grows older, other sources such as green leafy vegetables and ragi are\\nadded to the diet to meet calcium needs.\\n\\nDuring the last trimester of pregnancy, the well-nourished foetus builds up iron stores, so that at\\nbirth the infant has sufficient iron, stored to meet his/her needs for the first four to five months of life.\\nMilk, which is the first food of the infant, is considered a complete food, but it is low in iron. A food\\nsupplement, which supplies iron, needs to be added, to the infant’s diet, by the age of five to six\\nmonths, when it is needed.\\n\\nWhen the mother is well fed, the breast milk furnishes sufficient amount of vitamins, the only\\nexception being vitamin D and perhaps vitamin C. The same is true for substitute milk used in infant\\nfeeding, except the fact that it contains insufficient amounts of vitamin C. Therefore, sweet lime,\\norange juice or some other juice high in vitamin C is usually added as one of the first supplements to the\\ninfant’s diet. The other supplement is a vitamin D concentrate, which is added in the form of fish liver\\noil.\\n\\nFigure 16.2: Baby’s stomach–actual size at different ages.\\n\\nWater\\nAn infant is sometimes referred to as a bubble of water, due to its high proportion of body water.\\n\\nA baby has a high surface area per unit of body-weight, breathes faster, and therefore loses a lot of\\n\\nat Birth Capacity:\\n2 Tablespoons or\\n\\n30 ml\\n\\nat 2 weeks\\nCapacity:\\n\\n4 Tablespoons or\\n55 ml\\n\\nat 3 months\\nCapacity:\\n\\n8 Tablespoons or\\n120 ml\\n\\n\\n\\n194194194194194 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nwater, especially when he is dressed in warm clothing in warm, humid weather. He needs more water\\nthan adults to excrete body wastes. Therefore, an infant needs about 160 ml of water per kg per day.\\nThough most of the needs is met by milk, it is necessary to give boiled, cooled water between feedings.\\n\\nBreast Feeding\\n\\nHuman milk is more readily assimilated than cow’s milk, for it is produced to suit the baby’s\\ndigestive system. Breast milk is free from contamination, and is available at the right temperature\\nwithout effort.\\n\\nBreast feeding prolongs the period of natural immunity to virus diseases. These include mumps,\\nmeasles, polio, some kinds of pneumonia and some infantile diarrhoeas. Babies fed on breast milk are\\nalso less likely to develop constipation and certain common infant allergies. Breast feeding does make\\npossible an exceptionally close and harmonious relationship that is enjoyable and satisfying to both\\ninfant and mother. It should also be mentioned that in the case of a major disaster, which disrupts the\\nsupply services (water, milk, electricity, etc.), a baby’s survival may depend on breast feeding. Another\\nconsideration in this atomic age is the presence of radioactive fallout as strontium–90. The consensus\\nof scientific thought is that the amount of contamination in breast milk is likely to be smaller than in\\nformula milk.\\n\\nHuman milk is specifically made to meet the needs of human infants. The best commercial\\nformulas therefore are modified from cow’s/buffalo’s milk to approximate the known composition of\\nhuman breast milk.\\n\\nUnfortunately, even today, the increasing trend towards bottle feeding results in increased infant\\nsickness and mortality, due to (i) ignorance of the basic rules of sanitation, (ii) insanitary preparation\\nand poor handling of bottles and milk formula, and (iii) use of milk substitutes of poor nutrient content.\\n\\nThough the mortality rate for artificially fed infants has been greatly reduced, it is still high for\\nthis group, especially in the lower economic groups. This may be due to lack of water for cleaning,\\nhigh ambient temperature, lack of facilities for making the formula and lack of refrigeration. Mothers in\\nthis group do not have proper instructions in formula preparation and storage of prepared formula. An\\nadequate diet, exercise, rest, and freedom from anxiety are important during prenatal period as well as\\nduring lactation.\\n\\nColostrum\\nThe secretion from the breast in the first few days after delivery, is called colostrum. It has a high\\n\\nprotein and vitamin A content and confers an immunity to certain infections during the first few\\nmonths. It aids the development of the digestive enzymes. Therefore, it is important that the new born\\nis breastfed from the first day and should be fed colostrum within an hour after birth.\\n\\nWhen Breast Feeding is not Advisable\\nBreast feeding must be discontinued when:\\n1. Mother suffers from chronic illnesses such as tuberculosis, epilepsy, insanity, chronic fevers,\\n\\nsevere anaemia, nephritis or cardiac disease.\\n2. The infant is weak or unable to nurse due to cleft palate or harelip.\\n3. Temporary stoppage of breast feeding is advisable when the mother acquires an acute infection,\\n\\nwhich the baby has not yet got. In scuh a condition the mother must empty out the breasts\\nat regular intervals manually or with a pump, to prevent the milk supply from drying up.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 195195195195195\\n\\nNutrients\\n\\nThere are no other reasons to stop breast feeding. It must be continued even if child has loose\\nstools, is vomiting or has any minor or major illness.\\n\\nWhen the child is unable to suck because of illness, breast milk can be expressed and fed.\\n\\nBottle Feeding\\n\\nWhen a child needs to be bottle fed, most widely used substitute for human milk is cow’s or\\nmodified buffalo’s milk. The substitutes differ from human milk in composition. Table 16.4 gives\\ncomparison of human milk with milk of other species.\\n\\nIt may be noted that the protein content of these is about three times that of human milk. The type\\nof protein present is also different. The fat content is similar in the milk of these species. Human milk\\ncontains about twice as much lactose as cow’s or buffalo’s milk. The energy supplied per 100 ml is\\nabout the same. Cow’s milk contains more than three times as much mineral ash as human milk. This\\ncreates a high solute load for the kidneys to excrete. This problem is corrected by diluting the milk.\\nSugar is added to counteract the effect of dilution on energy supply.\\n\\nThe modifications made in cow’s or buffalo’s milk to prepare commercial formulas are:\\n1. Protein content is usually lowered; if possible, protein is treated to produce soft curd.\\n2. Carbohydrate such as glucose or sucrose is added.\\n3. Butter fat is reduced, if need be.\\n4. Calcium level is reduced by dilution.\\n5. Vitamins A, D and ascorbic acid are usually added.\\n6. Iron may be added.\\n\\nTable 16.4: Composition of Milk from Various Species (per 100 ml)1\\n\\nHuman Cow’s Goat’s Buffalo’s Ass’s\\nmilk milk milk milk milk\\n\\nEnergy (kcal) 65 67 72 117 48\\n\\nProtein (g) 1.1 3.2 3.3 4.3 2.1\\n\\nFat (g) 3.4 4.1 4.5 8.8 1.5\\n\\nCarbohydrate (g) 7.4 4.4 4.6 5.0 6.5\\n\\nMinerals (g) 0.1 0.8 0.8 0.8 —\\n\\nCalcium (mg) 28 120 170 210 80\\n\\nPhosphorus (mg) 11 90 120 130 —\\n\\nIron (mg) — 0.2 0.3 0.2 —\\n\\nVitamin A (mcg) 42 52 54 48 —\\n\\nThiamin (mcg) 20 50 50 40 60\\n\\nRiboflavin (mcg) 20 190 40 100 30\\n\\nNiacin (mcg) — 100 300 100 100\\n\\nVitamin C (mg) 3 2 1 1 10\\n\\n1. Nutritive Value of Indian Foods, 1971.\\n\\n\\n\\n196196196196196 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nSupplementary Foods for Infants and Toddlers\\n\\nIntroduction of First Solid Foods: The age at which the first solid is introduced and the types\\nof food given is dependent on who decides this–the parents, grandparents or other relatives. It also\\ndepends on whether the family has access to a pediatrician, a family doctor, a health visitor, or a\\nprimary centre nurse. The advice will vary from one region of India to another.\\n\\nIn most regions there is a feast to celebrate this occasion. The first solid foods are normally\\nintroduced at five to six months of age. The foods given are cereals, cereal-milk or cereal/dal preparations\\nsuch as suji halwa, rice-milk, upma, rice-dal, khichdi, pongal, bread, rice flakes/poha, etc. Fruits such\\nas ripe banana, mango, papaya, which are soft and pulpy are also given. Well cooked, non-fibrous\\nvegetables such as ashgourd, potato, pumpkin are fed along with rice.\\n\\nIt is important to make this transition to solid foods an enjoyable one. The amount of food offered\\nand swallowed in the beginning is a teaspoon or so. It is normal for the infant to bring the food out, for\\nthe ability to swallow is developed very slowly. The infant enjoys this transition, if the mother is relaxed\\nat the time of feeding and the food is not forced. The infant can accept the food better, if it is not\\ndistracted by other activities while feeding.\\n\\nThe number and kinds of foods given are slowly increased as the child approaches the first\\nbirthday. By the end of the second year, the toddler is able to partake of the normal family meals.\\n\\nThe Kinds of Foods Given\\nThe first food fed is normally cooked cereals, which are prepared for the family or prepared baby\\n\\ncereals may be purchased. The cereal must be thoroughly cooked, if coarse, it should be strained. The\\ncereal at first is mixed with milk, curd, buttermilk or dal soup. The amount given is gradually increased\\nto four or five teaspoons by the seventh or eighth month.\\n\\nDal: Soft cooked dal (varan), dal soup can be mixed with rice and fed. Mixed preparation such\\nas khichdi or pongal (rice and mung dal), idli (rice and urad dal), dhokla (chana dal and dahi), and\\nany similar preparations can be fed by seven to eight months of age.\\n\\nFruits, Mashed, Strained: Fruits such as banana, mangoes, papaya, etc., are started at about five\\nmonths of age. Cooked or baked apples may also be fed after removal of skin and other fibrous parts.\\nMild flavoured fruits in small amounts are a good choice to begin with.\\n\\nVegetables: Cooked and mashed or strained vegetables in small amounts can be added a little to\\nthe cereal by six to eight months. By the end of first year, the consistency of vegetables fed to the  baby\\nshould be changed over gradually to chopped or coarsely mashed cooked vegetables. The baby needs\\nto learn to like different flavours and textures. The addition of vegetables and fruits helps to achieve this\\nobjective.\\n\\nEgg: Egg yolk can be given to the infant between the age of four to six months of age. The yolk\\ncontains protein, iron and vitamins which are valuable additions to the baby’s diet. Hard cooked egg\\nyolk seems to agree well with the babies. A very small amount is given in the beginning. The white of\\nthe egg is given only by the end of first year, as some babies are allergic to it.\\n\\nFish and Meat: Cooked ground and strained fish and meat may be given about the same time as\\negg yolk at five to six months of age. The fish or meat serving may be alternated with egg yolk and dal.\\n\\nFeeding Schedules: Modern trend is to have flexible feeding schedules and not rigid. These are\\nbased on signs of hunger in the individual infant rather than on fixed hours of feeding. After the first\\nfew weeks, a healthy infant will develop a self-regulated feeding schedule of this own. The number of\\nfeeds will reduce to about six by the time the infant is six months of age.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 197197197197197\\n\\nA very small amount of each new food should be added to the infant’s diet. New foods should be\\nintroduced gradually, one at a time to permit the infant to get used to it. The foods should be of soft,\\nsmooth consistency. It is normal for an infant to bring out the food in the beginning until the ability to\\nswallow is established. The child should be encouraged to try new flavours and textures.\\n\\nThe amount of feed should be increased as the number decreases. By the beginning of the second\\nyear, the baby will have three to four meals. The foods included for a good daily diet for a one year old\\nchild are given in Table 16.5.\\n\\nTable 16.5: Diet for One Year Old Child.\\n\\nMilk 2 to 3 cups Fruit for Vitamin C 1 serving\\n\\nDal 2 tablespoons Other Fruit 1/4 cup\\n\\nEgg 1 Rice* 1/4 cup (cooked)\\n\\nor Meat or Fish 2 tablespoons Chapati/bread 1/2 to 1 chapati or\\nsliced bread\\n\\nCooked green or 2 tablespoons Butter/ghee\\nyellow vegetable vanaspati 1 teaspoon\\n\\nOther vegetables 2 tablespoons Fish liver oil Enough to supply 5\\nincluding potatoes mcg (200 I.U.)\\n\\nvitamin D\\n\\n      *Rawa, ragi, jowar, pohe or any other cereal could wholly or partially replace rice.\\n\\nHelping Children to Develop Good Food Habits\\n\\nMost of the problems of food acceptance begin in the toddler stage. The problem starts with the\\nmother, who thinks that the child should be well fed, and tries to feed the child more food than it needs.\\nThe child will show a marked decrease in appetite in the second year, because the child grows at a\\nslower rate in the second year as compared to the first year. So it is important to give small portions of\\nfood and let him/her enjoy food. Allow the child some freedom to decide when he/she is satisfied.\\nAllow some flexibility in choices and help the child form good food habits gradually. Learning is a slow\\nprocess and is helped by the adults having patience and a sportive attitude, never by bribe, admonition\\nor punishment.\\n\\nToddlers\\n\\nChildren can share family meals, by the time, they are two years old. A few alternatives may be\\nneeded, when the family makes highly spiced food. It is advisable to keep foods, which are too fatty or\\ntoo sweet out of the child’s menu. Such foods may fill his limited space, without providing the nutrients\\nneeded. The child may be encouraged to eat sweets towards the end of the meal, so that he/she may\\nnot eat these to the exclusion of other foods.\\n\\nIt is good to give appetising beverages such as fruit juices and milk to the children. It is good to\\nserve part of his milk needs in the form of soups, kheer, custard or icecream. Fruits are ideal snacks.\\nCrisp crackers or toast are liked and the child can eat these without help, which helps him to feel\\nindependent.\\n\\n\\n\\n198198198198198 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIndications of Good Health\\n\\nSome indications are visible, and can be measured and recorded, others are qualitative, and not\\neasily recorded.\\n\\nThe most common measurable criterion is regular gain in weight. At birth an average healthy\\nbaby weights about three to three and half kg. A little loss of weight is observed in the first few days,\\nbut it is regained within two weeks. From this point, the child gains weight regularly. It doubles its birth\\nweight between four to six months of age and triples it by the end of 10–12 months. Therefore, slow\\nweight gain or stationary weight is the first indication of something amiss in the infant care.\\n\\nOther signs of good health are rosy cheeks, bright eyes, firm layer of subcutaneous fat, normal\\neruption of teeth, good sleep and regular elimination. A healthy baby is a happy baby.\\n\\nMeal Planning for School Children and Adolescents\\n\\nOnce the child starts going to school, the attention of the parents is diverted to his/her school\\nwork and food becomes a secondary matter. As a result the nutritional needs of the child of school age\\nare often overlooked. If the child was well-nourished as he entered school, the effect of neglect during\\nschool years does not show up for some time.\\n\\nThe nutritional needs do not change very much during school years except for a gradual increase\\nin food intake to meet the needs of the growing body. But going to school does mean that the meals and\\nactivities have to be planned to fit in the school schedule. It is necessary to eat one meal away from\\nhome, wich may be a box lunch or snacks bought at school.\\n\\nFood Needs of the School Child — 6–12 Years Old\\n\\nAt this stage it is important to ensure that each meal carries sufficient amounts of protein, minerals\\nand vitamins. The food needs are increased in keeping with the child’s growth rate and activity. The\\nkinds of food needed are the same as those for younger children but the amounts needed are increased.\\nThe children of this age can take most of the foods served in the family meals, except highly spiced or\\nfried foods, strong tea and coffee. The child can take all fruits at this age, including those which have\\nseeds as guavas and grapes which were not suitable at a younger age. He can eat many foods, which\\nneed biting and chewing such as popped cereals, roasted groundnuts and bengal gram, roasted corn on\\nthe cob, amla, bor, etc.\\n\\nSpacing and Time of Meals\\nChildren usually need four or five meals. The child should be encouraged to get up about half an\\n\\nhour before breakfast. About twenty minutes may be needed for the meal. When the child goes to\\nschool, its a good idea to allow about half an hour between breakfast and school time for the child to\\nget ready. Lunch time should be midway between breakfast and dinner. Some children need a mid-\\nmorning as well as, a mid-afternoon snack.\\n\\nBreakfast the Neglected Meal\\nWith the need to adjust to the school time, the first meal is either scanty or omitted entirely. This\\n\\nis a hazard from the nutritional point of view. For a missed meal is hard to make up. There are many\\nreasons why a child dons not have a good breakfast. The breakfast may not be ready in time and\\ntherefore the child may not be able to eat it and reach the school in time. The child may not get up in\\ntime and therefore the breakfast may be hurried. If the child does not go to bed in time, it is difficult for\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 199199199199199\\n\\nhim to get up early enough to find time to get ready for school and eat a good breakfast. The child’s\\nability to attend classes and learn his lessons at school may be affected, if he is hungry during school\\nhour, due to a poor breakfast.\\n\\nBreakfast can be a very enjoyable and varied meal. Some of the traditional breakfasts from some\\nregions are given in Table 16.6.\\n\\nTable 16.6: Regional Breakfast\\n\\nRegion Breakfast foods\\n\\nPunjab Parantha and lassi\\n\\nMaharashtra Shira and milk, Dahi-pohe, Doodh-pohe\\n\\nMadras Idli chutney and coffee, Dosa Chuteney &\\nCoffee, milk beverage\\n\\nMysore Ragi preparation and butter milk\\n\\nModern pattern in all regions Bread and butter, egg, fruit, milk, tea/coffee\\n\\nA good breakfast should include some cereal or cereal dal preparation, some milk and fruit.\\nHowever, if the fruit is preferred at some other time in the day, it may be omitted from the breakfast.\\n\\nLunch\\nThis meal may have to be eaten away from home, which is a major change for the child at this\\n\\nstage. It requires considerable planning and management to ensure that a child is well fed even when\\nshe/he eats away from home. The foods, which must find a place in the packed lunch include—(a)\\ncereal preparation such as chapati, upma, bread, etc., (b) pulse or milk product, which may be usal,\\ndal, til chutni, curd, lassi, milk or roasted groundnuts, (c) vegetable preparation or fruit. You can make\\none dish, which contains foods from all the three groups, in which oil, butter, ghee, sugar and/or\\njaggery are hidden or visible ingredients. Some preparations, which are children’s favourites, are:\\n\\n• Masalabhaat (made with rice, mung dal  and vegetable–cabbages, carrots, peas).\\n• Thalipeeth (made from a mixture of cereals and pulses flour and vegetables.\\n• Dahi-bhaat, tomato or cucumber slices and lemon pickle.\\n• Shira, milk and fruit (banana, grapes, guava, orange).\\n• Sandwiches of cheese or paneer, tomato and cucumber.\\n• Chapati, usal and carrot salad.\\n\\nAs you can see there are many more variations, which can be made from foods from the groups\\nindicated. When the children eat with their friends and share their lunch with them at school, it improves\\ntheir enjoyment of the meal. Such sharing may enlarge their food exposure and add variety.\\n\\nThere are some points, which must be remembered, in making a packed lunch, which is enjoyable.\\nThese are:\\n\\n• Cool the preparation before packing to avoid spoilage.\\n• Pack food preparations, which taste good even when these are cold.\\n\\n\\n\\n200200200200200 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n• Include some fresh vegetable or fruit, to help moisten the mouth.\\n• Pack the vegetable/fruit slices in a plastic bag, to retain fresh flavour and texture.\\n• Pack only as much as the child can eat happily, so that children learn to value food and do not\\n\\nwaste it.\\n\\nBetween Meal Snacks\\n\\nSome children may need a mid-morning and a mid-afternoon snack. A number of foods are\\nnormally available, these include fruits such as guavas, bananas, amlas, bor, etc. roasted legumes such\\nas groundnuts, chanas, etc. These are available near school in addition to the snacks sold in the school\\ncanteen. If well chosen, these snacks can provide important nutrients in addition to calories. If the\\nchildren buy candy, peppermints, soft drinks, ice fruit, they get mainly calories only. These foods\\nreduce or dull the appetite, without meeting the body’s need. Such foods supply only energy. Therefore,\\nthese foods are said to provide only “empty calories”.\\n\\nThe Adolescent—12–16 years\\n\\nThis is a stage of rapid growth and intense activity. Individual variation is also great in this age\\ngroup. A number of physical, emotional and mental changes occur in this period of life. Girls mature\\nbetween 11 and 13 years of age, whereas the major changes occur in boys between 13 and 15 years.\\n\\nIt is normal for boys to eat a lot at this age, especially if they are fond of outdoor sports. The need\\nto meet their nutritional needs through good planning cannot be overemphasised.\\n\\nIt may be noted from the table of recommended allowances that the need for all nutrients is\\nincreased at adolescence. Therefore, it is important to plan to supply sufficient amounts of proteins,\\nminerals and vitamins in each meal.\\n\\nAdolescence is the age of group activities. Therefore, if nutrition education is imparted as a group\\nactivity, it may help in improving eating habits.\\n\\nMeeting Food Needs of Adolescents\\nThe increased needs of this period can be met if increased amounts of foods listed in the daily\\n\\nguide are included in the diet. Boys may need to consume a lot of energy rich foods, in order to provide\\nsufficient energy.\\n\\nGirls may need to pay special attention to foods rich in protein, iron and other nutrients necessary\\nfor synthesis and regeneration of red blood cells. The girl’s diet should include all foods listed in the\\nfood guide, with special attention to iron rich foods such as dals, leafy green vegetables, dried fruits\\nand egg, liver and red meats may also be used if acceptable.\\n\\nIt is important for adolescents to gain appropriate weight for their height and body build. Any\\ndeviation from normal indicates some feeding problem, which must be identified and corrected with\\nthe help of a nutritionist or dietician. Checking a three day food intake record, may help in identifying\\nthe specific lack or excess and thus form the basis of a plan of action.\\n\\nDiet During 17–21 years\\nGrowth is usually slow in this stage of life. But there is certain degree of maturation of the body\\n\\ntissues, which is aided by good nutrition.\\nIf the boys and girls are away in hostels, they tend to economise on food, especially if the food\\n\\ncharges are collected on the basis of meals eaten.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 201201201201201\\n\\nA number of institutions (colleges/universities) provide accommodation and food at moderate\\ncost to this age group; part of the establishment cost is paid as subsidy by the government to reduce\\nfood cost to the college students.\\n\\nIt is necessary to educate this group about the relationship between the food intake and body’s\\nneeds to store up nutrients in preparation for the responsibilities of adulthood.\\n\\nNutrition for Middle Age Adults (40 – 60 yrs.)\\nOften the middle years are a stage of stability in life. Normally the person is efficient in one’s\\n\\nprofession, income is steady, the physical demands of caring for children are over. The basal metabolic\\nrate starts decreasing from 30 years of age.\\n\\nThus the energy need decreases, but the need for other nutrients (proteins, minerals and vitamins)\\ndo not decrease.\\n\\nAs for adults, food selection is made according to the Daily Food Guide (Table 14.1). The\\nnumber of servings included from various groups will be dependent on the body size and activity of the\\nperson. In general, the reduction in energy intake can be achieved by decreasing intake of sugar,\\nsweets, oils and fats to ensure that the body weight is maintained at a desirable level. A sensible\\nprogramme of regular exercise, such as walking and yoga can help to maintain optimum health.\\n\\nNutrition for Senior Citizen (60 + years)\\nThe rate of aging varies fronm one person to another. There are several factors which affect the\\n\\naging, which include heredity, the psycho-social and nutritional background and activity pattern. Due\\nto these variations, no two people age in a similar manner.\\n\\nOne reassuring observation is that people, who keep physically and mentally active have been\\nreported to retain their sense of smell and taste even in their eighties. Those who practise weight-lifting\\nare able to retain their lean muscle mass and the density of their bones. If teeth are lost, well-fitting\\ndentures permit enjoyment of foods of varying texture. Use of hearing aid helps those with hearing\\ndefects to maintain social contact. Lens implants after cataract surgery permit reading and free movement\\nthus ensuring the ability to pursue intellectual interests.\\n\\nThus more senior citizens are found to be travelling and participating in social and community\\nactivities than they did before the development of technologies mentioned above.\\n\\nHow does one avoid potential problems?\\nHealthy eating habits throughout life helps to maintain physical well-being. Regular fitness\\n\\nprogramme of one’s choice helps to prevent physical deterioration. Enjoyable social activities help to\\nkeep a happy frame of mind. A happy outlook, a regular practice of prayer and thankfulness are assets\\nwhich ensure a happy life at all stages including late years.\\n\\nTry to live life in a way that requires less use of medicines. If sleepy, try a short nap or meditation\\ninstead of taking stimulants like tea or coffee. If you suffer from constipation, try taking enough\\nexercise with regular intake of fiber and water.\\n\\nNutritional Requirements: Normal nutritional needs remain throughout life. Good nutrition can\\nspeed recovery from illness and generally can improve the spirit and quality of life and even prolong\\nlife. It is necessary to know the extent to which aging has affected a person’s physiological capabilities.\\nThe declines in physiological functions with aging primarily of sedentary people are depicted in Figure\\n16.3.\\n\\nExcept for energy need, due to decrease in the metabolic rate (Table 16.7), the need for all the\\nnutrients remains the same as before.\\n\\n\\n\\n202202202202202 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n% Reduction\\nin BMR(1)\\nAfter 30 yrs\\n\\nAge\\nYrs\\n\\nFigure 16.3 The declines in physiological functions with aging in sedentary people\\n\\nTable 16.7: Variation in Energy Needs (Basal & Total) of Senior Citizen with Age\\n\\nMale (60 kg) Female (50 kg)\\n\\nBasal energy Total energy Basal energy Total energy\\nNeed in kcal(2) Need in kcal Need in kcal (2) Need in kcal\\n\\n(A) (A) x1.6 (A) (A)x 1.6\\n\\n30 100 1515 2424 1171 1874\\n\\n31–40 3 1470 2352 1136 1818\\n\\n41–50 3 1424 2279 1101 1762\\n\\n51–60 7.5 1310 2096 1013 1621\\n\\n61–70 7.5 1197 1915 925 1480\\n\\n71–80 10 1045 1672 808 1293\\n\\n1.

Vitamin requirements\\ndo not change after the age of 50 except for a slight decrease in the need for thiamin, riboflavin and\\nniacin, which are proportional to the total energy intake (Table 16.7).\\n\\n\\n\\nMeal Planning for Various Age Groups 203203203203203\\n\\nFood and Other Habits of Senior Citizens\\n\\nSome food habits of older persons are nutritionally poor. These include excessive use of sago and\\npotatoes in place of a meal on particular week days such as Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday or\\nSaturday; Ekadashi, Pradosh (biweekly) and Sankashti (monthly). Some may observe fast by taking\\ndrinks only such as tea, coffee, lemon sherbet and buttermilk. Loneliness may reduce the intake of\\nproper meals. Proper meals may be substituted with snack foods such as toast, upma etc. They may\\nthink they have eaten, when they have not, due to forgetfulness. At times they may ask for meals when\\nthey have already eaten, annoying relatives and caretakers. They may reduce water intake to avoid\\nhaving to use the bathroom in the night. This results in constipation.\\n\\nReduced movement to avoid falls and accidents affects circulation, digestion and muscle tone\\nadversely.\\n\\nIf the diet intake is reduced to less than 1500kcal/day, a multi-vitamin tablet/capsule needs to be\\ntaken to meet the recommended allowances. Intake of a variety of nutrient dense foods should be\\nencouraged. Intake of sufficient water is necessary to prevent constipation, to maintain urinary volume\\nand to prevent dehydration. Poor or missing teeth may decrease intake of vegetable and protein foods.\\nIn such cases, blended vegetable and protein rich soups can be used.\\n\\nAny adjustment in food habits must be carefully made in consultation with the person concerned.\\n\\nFood Habits and the Elderly\\n\\nElderly persons crave for attention and are often duped into buying unnecessary food supplements\\nand special foods. The sales person appears to be interested in their health and persuades them to buy\\nexpensive food supplements and special foods. Thus they spend money that could be used to buy\\nordinary foods recommended in the food guide, which could provide more nutrients at less cost.\\n\\nIn short, a basic plan for health promotion and disease prevention includes eating a proper diet\\nthat focuses on a variety of foods and moderation in food intake, exercising regularly, abstaining from\\nsmoking, limiting alcohol intake and limiting stress.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

For example,\\nrice is grown in certain parts of our country and it forms the staple in those regions; similarly wheat,\\njowar, bajra, makka (corn) and ragi are used as staples, where these are the major crops. Secondly, the\\namounts and kinds of foods we eat is affected by the money that can be spent for food. Thirdly, our\\nfamily’s meal pattern is dictated by the geographic region, religion, community and family practices\\ndeveloped over several generations.\\n\\nThe dals, the vegetables and fruits, which we habitually include in our menu, are mainly those,\\nwhich were a part of our regional meal pattern. Even when we move to other regions for work or\\nbusiness, we tend to retain a large part of our food heritage. For example, Punjabis residing in Bombay\\nor Calcutta, retain their food pattern, which includes wheat parantha, rajmah, palak, and peas, etc. A\\nTamilian in similar situation would include, rice, sambar made from tur dal and vegetables such as ash\\ngourd and amaranth. As you know, it makes little difference whether the leafy vegetable used is amaranth\\nor palak from the nutritional point of view, for both provide pro-vitamin A in substantial amount. Thus\\nthe regional patterns can meet the nutritional needs of people, if sufficient food from each of the five\\ngroups is included; the particular food chosen from each group and the way it is prepared is a matter\\nof individual choice.\\n\\nIn addition to these regional variations in food acceptance pattern, two major patterns are prevalent\\nin the world—the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian dietary. Let us examine and understand how these\\naffect our food choices and nutrition.\\n\\nIt is good to remember that in India, vegetarians include milk and milk products such as curds,\\nlassi, paneer, cheese, buttermilk, etc., which are animal foods, in their diets; while the Indian non-\\nvegetarians may exclude fish, eggs and meat from their menu on certain days of the week, such as\\n\\n\\n\\n206206206206206 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nMondays, Thursdays and/or Saturdays; these factors need to be taken into account while examining\\nthese dietaries. Let us understand the historical basis of evolution of the Indian dietary before discussion\\nits nutritional aspects.\\n\\nEvolution of the Vegetarian Dietary Pattern1\\n\\nBefore the advent of Jainism, there appears to have been no restriction in the food acceptance of\\nour people, except on an individual voluntary basis. The philosophy of non-violence, which was preached\\nby the prophets of Jainism had a profound influence on the dietary practices of their followers. Jainism\\ncan be traced back to three centuries before the advent of Buddhism, i.e., 800 BC Mahavira Vardhamana,\\na Jain prophet and a contemporary of Bhagvan Gautama Buddha, was responsible for the spread of\\nJainism and its concept of abstinence from flesh foods. Emperor Ashoka the Great (about 264 BC),\\nbecame an exponent of Budhhism. Not only did he become a vegetarian, but he refrained from hunting\\nand banned it in his kingdom. One of the reasons for abstaining from flesh foods was the belief in the\\ntransmigration of souls between living beings, which, included animals. Thus Vegetarianism represents\\na conscious choice with respect to one’s diet, which is quite different from foregoing meat because it\\nis expensive. Thus it does not connote a dietary practice only, but is a way of life that has cultural and\\nspiritual implications. Abstinence from meat, as a dietary discipline, is evident in most religious practices.\\nFor meat is avoided by certain Christian sects during Lent; Muslims avoid pork, and Hindus avoid meat\\nduring religious celebrations.\\n\\nPythagoras, the Greek philosopher, who was a contemporary of Gautama Buddha, believed in the\\ntransmigration of souls, and espoused the cause of vegetarianism. In fact, he is recognised as the\\nfounder of vegetarianism in Europe. The ethical aspects of non-violence seem to have appealed to\\nsome of the thinkers, such as, Sir Francis Bacon and George Bernard Shaw, and they became vegetarians.\\nThus the movement to popularise vegetarianism as a desirable dietary practice, started in the Western\\ncountries. Leonardo da Vinci, the Italian painter, Sir Issac Newton, the British physicist, John Wesley,\\nthe founder of the Methodist Church, Helena Blavatsky, the founder of the theosophical movement,\\nand Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian leader, who practised non-violence, were some of the great protagonists\\nof vegetarianism.\\n\\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, vegetarianism flourished under the leadership, of breakfast cereal\\ndevelopers Kellogg, Graham and Post, as well as writers such as Uptom Sinclair. In 1978, there were\\n9 to 10 million Americans, who were vegetarians, according to a Roper poll. In addition, there were 40\\nto 50 million people, who restricted the consumption of meat in the United States of America. This\\ntrend is observed in other Western countries also.\\n\\nVegetarian Dietary Patterns\\n\\nThe traditional Indian dietary consists of cereal preparations, such as rice, chapati, roti,  as the\\nmain course, with preparations of dal, legumes, vegetables, dahi/buttermilk, as accompaniments to the\\nstaple food.\\n\\nThe word vegetarian is derived from the Latin root ‘vigitore’, meaning giving strength and health.\\nAccording to the Concise Oxford Dictionary, a vegetarian is one, who uses or advocates the use of a\\ndiet of vegetable foods, usually with the addition of milk, eggs, to the exclusion of meat. A person, who\\nincludes an animal food such as milk in the diet, cannot be a vegetarian, in the strict sense of the word.\\n\\n1. Mudambi, SR, and MV Rajgopal, Nutrition, 3(6), 373–78, 1987.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian Meal Patterns— Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian 207207207207207\\n\\nThus the word vegetarian, as used for the traditional Indian dietary, is a misnomer; and creates unnecessary\\nmisunderstanding about its identity and nutritional quality.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been an increase is the followers of vegetarian dietary pattern in the\\nWestern countries, as mentioned earlier. As a result; a number of variations of vegetarian dietary\\npattern have emerged. These fall into the following five groups:\\n\\n(a) Lactovegetarians are those, who include milk and milk products, in addition to plant foods,\\nsuch as cereals, dals, legumes, vegetables and fruits in their diet.\\n\\n(b) Ovolactovegetarians include eggs, milk and milk products, in addition to all the foods mentioned\\nin (a) above.\\n\\n(c) Ovo-vegetarians include eggs, in addition to the plant foods.\\n(d) Fruitarians include grains, nuts and fruits, i.e., the parts of plants, which are obtained\\n\\nwithout destruction of the plant itself.\\n(e) Vegans include only plant foods in their diets, and abstain from all animal foods, even milk\\n\\nand milk products. This is comparatively a new population group, that has emerged from\\nomnivores (who used to eat all plant and animal foods), in the Western countries.\\n\\nIn India, traditional vegetarians belong to the first group, the lacto vegetarians. The second group\\nis comparatively a recent development.\\n\\nAs we may realise, it is possible for vegetarians to select foods from the basic five groups and\\nmeet their nutritional requirements.\\n\\nNon-Vegetarian Dietary Patterns\\n\\nIt is good to remember that there are two distinct patterns of non-vegetarian diet observed around\\nthe world. The first is the Indian non-vegetarian pattern, which has a cereal preparation as a main\\ncourse with fish, poultry or meat dish as an accompaniment, in addition to vegetables, dal/pulse\\npreparation and salad. The fish or meat are served one to three times a week in the meal. The amount\\nof fish, poultry or meat served in such a diet is naturally smaller than when these foods are served as\\nthe main course.\\n\\nThe second non-vegetarian pattern is that which is followed in the Western countries such as\\nU.K., U.S.A., Canada and Europe, which has meat, fish or poultry dish as the main course, with\\npreparation of cereals, vegetables, fruits, as accompaniments to the main protein course. In such a\\nmeal, the animal foods such as chicken, fish or meat roast form the main course in each meal and thus\\nare eaten at least twice a day. Thus the total amount of animal protein consumed is several times that\\nincluded by those, who follow the traditional Indian non-vegetarian meal pattern, though both are\\ndesignated as non-vegetarian dietaries. This aspect needs to be remembered while assessing the nutritional\\nadequacy of these meal patterns.\\n\\nNutritional Adequacy of Indian Diets\\n\\nIt has been proved in a number of studies that dietaries made up of predominantly plant foods,\\ncan be nutritionally adequate, if these are derived from natural foods belonging to the basic five groups,\\nand meet the energy needs of the individual. As we know the Sherpas (in Himalayan expeditions), who\\nfollow a non-flesh dietary pattern, have demonstrated that their dietary is adequate to prepare them to\\nendure the most severe stress that can be laid on the human body-extreme altitude, almost unbearable\\ncold, supreme endurance and elephantine strength.\\n\\n\\n\\n208208208208208 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nLike any other diet, the adequacy of the vegetarian diet depends on the individual food selection.\\nIn reviewing typical menus from various countries around the world, nutritionists found that a diet,\\nwhich supplies 2500 calories, would contain 50 per cent more protein than needed by 98 per cent of the\\npopulation. It is difficult to find a mixed vegetarian diet that will produce a negative nitrogen balance,\\nunlesss a large part of it consists of sugar, jams, jellies and other essentially non-protein foods.\\n\\nThe myths about magical qualities of proteins, especially animal proteins, have been perpetuated\\nfor generations. It is important to take stock of the hard facts about overconsumption of proteins,\\nespecially in the form of animal foods.\\n\\nApart from the waste of money by overconsumption of animal proteins, the disposal of its\\nmetabolic waste products may overburden the kidneys and tax the body’s circulatory functions, due to\\nthe high fat and cholesterol intake. Last but not the least, the obesity, observed in the population, due to\\nthe high energy intake associated with such a diet, is a predisposing factor in a number of diseases\\nprevalent in the developed world. The major dietary risk to health in the U.S.A. and Europe comes from\\neating too much food and the wrong kind of food.\\n\\nThe dietary goals for the U.S.A. and U.K. have emphasised the need to reduce the animal foods,\\nsaturated fats and sugar in the diet, and increase the intake of whole grain unrefined cereals, vegetables\\nand fruits in the diet. There are several advantages in such a shift in diet. Plant foods are high in\\ncomplex carbohydrates, which according to the U.S. dietary goals, need to be increased to account for\\n55–60 per cent of the total energy intake. Animal foods such as meat, fish and eggs do not contain any\\ncarbohydrates. In addition, plant foods are good sources of fibre, which is needed for the maintenance\\nof muscle tone. Most plant foods are low in calories, as they contain a low percentage of fat.\\n\\nThe nutritional needs of Indians are met, when they follow the traditional vegetarian or non-\\nvegetarian dietary pattern. Please note that the staples in both Indian dietary patterns are cereals. The\\nfish, meat or poultry are served as only a side dish in the Indian menu, while in the Western menu it is\\nserved as the main course. Therefore, those, who follow the traditional Indian non-vegetarian pattern,\\nare likely to have very few health problems, resulting from excessive consumption of animal protein\\nfoods, such as degenerative diseases of heart, kidney and colon.\\n\\nSeveral studies have been carried out to assess the efficacy of predominantly vegetarian diets for\\nathletes and other sports persons and how these diets affect their performance. On the basis of these,\\na strict vegetarian diet is advocated for athletes and other sports—persons, for optimal endurance and\\nathletic skills. It is reported that a high carbohydrate and low protein diet increases the stamina of\\nbicycling athletes by 300 per cent, while skiiers fed high carbohydrate diet, were able to work about\\nthree times as long as on a very high fat diet. Thus the vegetarian diet is not only adequate to maintain\\ngood health, but is also appropriate for athletes, be they runners, bicyclists or cross-country skiiers.\\n\\nImportant Nutritional Aspects of our Dietary Pattern\\n\\nThere are several desirable practices in our meal pattern. It is important to understand the nutritional\\nsignificance of these and ensure their retention. For example, we grind whole wheat and use the flour\\nto prepare chapaties, phulkas, or puri. Thus we get all the minerals and vitamins present in the outer\\nlayers of the grain. If we substitute bread or other products made from maida (refind wheat flour), in\\nour dietary in place of chapati, made from whole wheat flour, we would be deprived of iron, thiamin\\nand niacin, present in the whole wheat flour. For example, bread, which is made from maida, contains\\na fifth of the vitamin thiamin, found in whole wheat flour. Therefore use of bread in place of chapati is\\n\\n\\n\\nIndian Meal Patterns— Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian 209209209209209\\n\\nnot a desirable change from nutritional point of view. Similarly, we make roti or bhakari of flour made\\nfrom whole jowar, bajra, makka or ragi, which is a good practice and must be retained.\\n\\nIn some parts of India, parboiled rice is used, which is an excellent practice, as it is richer in\\nminerals and vitamins than raw milled rice. It is important to retain and cultivate the use of parboiled\\nrice.\\n\\nIn our traditional diet, a number of fermented foods are made, which not only add variety, but\\nalso important nutrients to our menu. For example, fermented foods, like idli, dhokla, curds, buttermilk\\nand lassi, have higher amount of B-vitamins than the unfermented rice, dal and milk from which these\\nare made. A word of caution, please remember that most of the instant mixes you buy for convenience,\\nrely on chemical additives to leaven the product and therefore lack the nutritional improvement we get\\nduring fermentation in these foods, when these are made by the traditional process.\\n\\nAnother desirable practice is the use of germinated pulses in our traditional dietary. As you may\\nknow, during the germination of food, vitamin C is synthesised, thus improving the nutritional content\\nof the food. Another practical benefit of germinated foods is that they need less time to cook and are\\neasy to digest. In some regions, germinated pulse preparations are made for special occasions and\\nshared. For example, in Maharashtra, germinated pulse usal is made and distributed to people on the\\nfifth day after a baby is born; in Mysore and Tamil Nadu, shundal, made from germinated chana, is\\ngiven to ladies and children, during Navaratri as a benediction. During Chaitra Gauri haldi-kumkum,\\ngerminated bengal-gram is given as a gift to ladies and girls in Maharashtra. These practices emphasise\\nthe use of germinated foods and must be retained to ensure good nutrition.\\n\\nIf you observe the traditional menus for everyday meals as also for feasts, you will notice that\\nleafy vegetables form an important part of it. For example, sarson-ka-sag (mustard greens) in Punjab,\\naluchee bhaji (colocaisa leaves) in Maharashtra and keere sambar (leafy vegetable soup) in Tamil Nadu\\nare examples of use of leafy vegetables in daily meals. Besides this, a traditional manu for weddings in\\nMaharashtra is not complete without a preparation of leafy vegetables, bengal gram dal and groundnuts.\\nIf we stop and examine our regional menus, we will find many examples of use of leafy vegetables in\\nthe menu. Retaining this rich food heritage will not only add to our eating pleasure, but also ensure good\\nnutrition.\\n\\nIn our regional menus we include a variety of salads, which we call koshimbir, raita or bharta. So\\nuse of a variety of salads also forms an important part of our traditional food pattern. We use curd,\\nlemon juice, mango scraping, roasted groundnuts, soaked dals (such as chana and mung), coriander\\nleaves, mint leaves, etc., as salad dressings, which add variety of flavours and improve the nutritive\\nvalue of the product. It is perhaps not out of place to mention, that these salad dressing are not fatty like\\nthe French dressing or mayonnaise, which some of you may be tempted to use in their place in order\\nto mimic the Western pattern.\\n\\nTraditionally fruits form a very important part of our tropical food heritage, for we have some\\nfruits in season all through the year. So you find that we use fruits as offerings in temple, and receive\\nthese as prasad (benediction). We give seasonal fruits as a gift to guests, especially ladies and children.\\nFruits are also the gift of choice, to be taken to sick relatives and friends, when we visit them in hospital\\nor at home. As you have learnt the nutritional contribution of fruits in the dietary, you can appreciate the\\nwisdom of retaining these traditional practices.\\n\\n\\n\\n210210210210210 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

The daily food\\nguide helps in deciding the kinds and amount of foods to be purchased.\\n\\nFood Selection and Purchase\\n\\nSelection of foods, from the available variety, is an important aspect of marketing. Intelligent\\nselection of foods from the basic five groups is based on the knowledge of attributes of high quality\\nfoods.\\n\\nHow often we purchase food depends on its storage life. Foods are classified, on the basis of\\ntheir stability during storage, into non-perishable, semi-perishable and perishable foods. Let us consider\\nthe criteria used for selection of various foods prior to purchase.\\n\\nFood Selection, Purchase and Storage\\n\\n\\n\\n214214214214214 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nNon-perishable Foods\\n\\nNon-perishable foods include whole grain cereals, whole and split pulses, nuts and oilseeds,\\nsugar and jaggery.\\n\\nCereals and dals supply about 330 to 350 k calories per 100 g. There is a distinct difference in the\\namount of protein supplied by these, the cereals supply only 7 to 12 per cent protein, while the dals and\\nwhole pulses supply twice as much protein, viz., 17 to 25 per cent.\\n\\nThe criteria for selection of all these with the exception of sugar and jaggery are similar.\\nGeneral Criteria of Selection: Whole grain cereals, dals and whole pulses (mung, chawli, math,\\n\\nrajmah, etc.) are selected on the basis of their appearance, feel, colour and variety. The grains are\\ninspected for uniform size, cleanliness, soundness of grain, absence of broken pieces, freedom from\\ninsect infestation, absence of admixture with foreign seeds and trash, dirt, mud, stones and sand.\\n\\nThe grain can be chewed to detect the texture and flavour. Hollow, soft fibrous texture indicates\\ndeterioration in quality. Sour or rancid flavour and odour indicate spoilage during storage. Nuts and\\noilseeds must be free from any absorbed or rancid odour and flavour.\\n\\nCereals: Cereals, millets and their products are the staple foods in the Indian dietary. It is important\\nthat these be selected carefully as they supply a major part of our energy, protein, iron and thiamin\\nneeds.\\n\\nGrain quality has two aspects. The first is physical quality, which refers to cleanliness, soundness\\nof grain and freedom from foreign matter. The second is processing quality, which means suitability\\nfor use. For example, thin long grain rice, which does not clump after cooking, is considered suitable\\nfor making pulao, a particular type of wheat is required to prepare puran poli, etc. Let us consider the\\nspecific criteria for selection of these foods.\\n\\nWheat is selected on the basis of the quality aspects mentioned above. Whole wheat is ground for\\nindividual use by the families. Whole wheat flour is mainly used to prepare unleavened bread (chapati,\\nroti, parantha, etc.) in India. In these preparations very little nutrient loss occurs. Normally consumers\\nbuy the variety that suits their needs in terms of performance. Not much information is available about\\nthe performance of various varieties in indigenous wheat preparations. Therefore, selection is based on\\nthe consumer’s personal knowledge and experience.\\n\\nRice is available as milled, hand-pounded and parboiled varieties. The degree of milling and polishing\\naffects the nutrient content. The parboiled rice and hand-pounded rice contain significant amounts of\\nthiamin; highly polished milled rice has very little thiamin.\\n\\nA number of grain types such as long, medium and short, are available. The selection is made\\ndepending on the intended use and price. For example, thin, long varieties are preferred for table use,\\nmedium and short varieties are used for preparations of rice made after grinding.\\n\\nIndians prefer the individual grains of rice to retain their identify after cooking. Ageing appears to\\nhelp develop this characteristic in the grain. It is observed that old grains absorb  more than two times\\ntheir volume of water during cooking, while new rice absorbs only two times their volume. It is\\ndifficult to judge the extent to which rice has aged, by its appearance, as no visual criteria of agening\\nhave been established, to guide the consumer.\\n\\nMillets: Other grains include bajra, jowar, ragi, maize and other millets, which are used as a\\nstaple. The criteria for selection are the same as for all grains—soundness of grain, cleanliness, freedom\\nfrom admixture with other grains and trash.\\n\\nMost of these millets are ground and the whole grain flour is used to prepare unleavened bread\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Selection, Purchase and Storage 215215215215215\\n\\n(roti). As whole grain flour is used in most preparations, very little loss of nutrients occurs. It must be\\nnoted that ragi is an exceptionally good source of calcium, and ragi and bajra of iron.\\n\\nDals and Pulses: Tur, mung, chana, lentil and urad, are the most used varieties. These are selected\\naccording to the general criteria of selection indicated above. Freedom from moisture, during storage,\\nis very important to avoid spoilage. The dals, which contain broken pieces, cost less than those, which\\ndo not. These less expensive ones can be used in preparations, which are made after grinding (wet or\\ndry) such as vadas, idli, dhokla, pakodas etc.\\n\\nSugar is made from sugarcane in India. It is normally available in three main forms—granulated,\\npowdered sugar and large crystals (khadi sakhar). Granulated sugar is the most commonly used sugar.\\nSelection is made on the basis of cleanliness and absence of dirt and dust. Jaggery is also made from\\nsugarcane in India. There are two main types. One is solid, light golden in colour, and the other is soft\\nand dark in colour. Jaggery is selected for colour and consistency needed in terms of intended use.\\nDark variety is preferred for preparations such as chikki, while light coloured variety may be used in\\npayasam  (milk pudding or kheer).\\n\\nSemi-perishable Foods\\n\\nThese include processed cereals and pulse products, roots and tubers, fats and oils.\\n\\nProcessed Cereals and Pulse Products\\n\\nA number of processed products are made from cereals and pulses. These include wheat products,\\nsuch as, cracked wheat, semolina (rawa), atta, maida, rice flakes, puffed rice (murmura), roasted\\nchana dal (dale), chana, etc. These are made by grinding the grain to varying degrees of fineness\\n(various particle sizes), by roasting the whole grain or by any other method. These processes increase\\nthe surface area of the product exposed to atmosphere, decrease the preparation time and also reduce\\nthe shelf-life of the products. While the whole grains have a shelf-life of a year or more, the shelf-life\\nof these processed products may vary from two weeks to a few months.\\n\\nBroken Wheat or Dalia is whole wheat coarsely ground into large particles. As the losses during\\nmilling are very little, it is a very nutritious food. Good quality is indicated by sweet taste and an\\nabsence of sour, mouldy odour and flavour. It spoils very quickly in storage, due to insect infestation.\\nIt can be cooked as such, made into upma, shira or porridge.\\n\\nSemolina, Suji or Rawa is available in varied sizes. The fine grain varieties are used for preparation\\nof halwas, while the large grain varieties are suitable for preparation of upma, shira, etc. These are\\nselected on the basis of uniformity of size, freedom from oxidised or mouldy odour, grit or bran.\\n\\nMaida is white finely extracted wheat flour. It is free from bran and has a lower content of\\nprotein, iron and B-vitamins. It has a lower shelf-life than semolina, as the large surface area permits\\nfaster rate of spoilage. Good quality maida is free from insect infestation, bad odours and lump formation.\\n\\nProcessed Rice Products\\nThese include rice flakes and rice puffs. Rice flakes are made after soaking the paddy in hot\\n\\nwater; parehing it by roasting and then flattening it by force while it is hot to form flakes. It retains a\\nlarge part of the iron and B-vitamin of the aleurone layer. The roasting helps to toast the grain, resulting\\nin partial cooking of the grain. It needs very little time to prepare and is used as a snack. It should be\\nfree from bran, broken particles, fragments of the seed coat, insects, stones, trash and bad odour.\\n\\n\\n\\n216216216216216 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nRice Puffs are another ready-to-eat rice product. It is selected for crispness, freedom from\\nstones, seedcoats, sand and dirt.\\n\\nRoasted chana dal and chanas are selected for crisp texture, sweet flavour and absence of flat\\nflavour.\\n\\nRoots and Tubers\\nThese include potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, tapioca (cassava), colocasia (aravi), yams and\\n\\nmany lesser known varieties of roots and tubers. In general, these should be firm, heavy, free from\\nbruises, spots, dirt and discolouration.\\n\\nPotatoes are chosen according to the recipe to be made. These should be free from sprouts,\\nheavy in relation to size, firm, with shallow eyes and without green discolouration. The varieties, which\\nhold their form during cooking, are preferred in most preparations.\\n\\nOnions—Select hard, well-shaped globes, with dry skins, free from spots and bruises.\\n\\nFats and Oils\\nA number of household fats are available in India. The choice depends on the food preparation in\\n\\nwhich the fat is to be used, the family needs, the food budget and regional preference.\\nGhee is preferred for its delicate flavour, in preparation of sweets (halwas especially) and to serve\\n\\nwith rice or snacks. Butter is used as a spread and in some baked products for the same reason.\\nOil is normally used for seasoning vegetables, dals and as a frying medium. The choice of oil\\n\\nvaries from one region to another, e.g., mustard oil is used in Bengal, coconut oil in Kerala, groundnut\\noil in Gujarat and gingelly (til) oil in Tamil Nadu.\\n\\nA large amount of oil is marketed as unrefined or crude oil. Criteria for selection of crude oil are\\npresence of the natural characteristic aroma, natural colour, clarity, freedom from admixture with\\nother kinds of oils, freedom from solid particles and flat or rancid odour.\\n\\nAll the oils and fats supply energy irrespective of their source. Most of the vegetable oils supply\\npoly unsaturated fatty acids (Table 18.1). The animals fats, ghee and butter, supply some vitamin A\\nalso. Some refined oils are fortified with vitamin A almost to the same level a cow’s ghee (750 mcg or\\n2500 I.U. per 100 g). Refined oils have a longer shelf-line than unrefined oils of the same kind. As\\nimpurities are removed in refining, the smoke points1 of refined oils during frying is higher than that of\\nunrefined oils. Refined oils are used in bakery products (bread, biscuits, etc.) by large bakeries.\\n\\nHydrogenated fats (vanaspati) are also available for use in food preparation. These are manufactured\\nfrom vegetable oils by the addition of molecular hydrogen to the double bonds in the unsaturated fatty\\nacids in  the presence of a catalyst. These are partially hydrogenated to obtain the physical characeristics\\ndesired in terms of texture and boiling point.\\n\\nThe product thus formed is more stable than the vegetable oil from which it is made. The process\\nis designed to produce characteristics most desired in terms of use and consumer acceptance. In India,\\nit is made as a substitute for ghee, and therefore its physical appearance and texture resembles ghee. It\\nis also fortified with vitamin A to the same level as ghee (750 mcg or 2500 I.U. per 1001g)  to protect\\nthe consumer. Hydrogenated fats have a higher smoke point than refined oils, and are used for frying\\nbland foods. These are also used in pastries.\\n\\n1. Smoke point is the temperature at which a fat or oil gives off a thin bluish smoke when heated.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Selection, Purchase and Storage 217217217217217\\n\\nOils and fats are selected for colour, clarity, characteristic aroma and absence of bad odour\\n(rancid), dirt, dust particles, etc., in the product.\\n\\nTable 18.1: Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA) in Oils & Fats1\\n\\nOil or Fat PUFA Content %\\n\\nKardi oil (Safflower) 75\\n\\nSoyabean oil 55\\n\\nCotton seed oil 50\\n\\nMaize (Corn) oil 45\\nTil (Sesame or gingelly) oil 42\\n\\nGroundnut oil 28\\n\\nMustard oil 25\\n\\nOlive oil 10\\n\\nCoconut oil 2\\n\\nVanaspati 6\\n\\nGhee (butterfat) 4\\n\\n  1. Nutritive Value of Indian Foods, p.149. ICMR; 197p.\\n\\nPerishable Foods\\n\\nPerishable foods include plant foods like fresh vegetables and fruits, and animals foods, such as\\nmilk, eggs, poultry, fish and meat.\\n\\nVegetables and fruits are good sources of vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Milk, eggs, flesh\\nfoods are good sources of proteins and B-vitamins. These foods are easily spoilt, if stored at room\\ntemperature, due to the action of enzymes and microorganisms.\\n\\nOne criterion for selection of perishable foods is that these must be fresh. In practice this means\\nmilk freshly drawn, fish freshly caught from a river or sea, meat soon after slaughter, eggs just laid,\\nvegetables just harvested from the garden and fruits just picked from the tree.\\n\\nAs population increases, foods have to be purchased further away from the point of production.\\nKnowledge of quality characteristics of foods may help you to select and purchase perishable foods.\\n\\nVegetables and Fruits\\n\\nVegetables and fruits make a meal attractive and enjoyable by the variety of colours, textures and\\nflavours they contribute. Vegetables and fruits are the major source of −β carotene and vitamin C in\\nthe diet. In addition they supply varying amounts of minerals and other vitamins also.\\n\\nMost fresh vegetables and fruits retain their freshness for a short time under ideal conditions of\\nstorage. Standards for selection of vegetables vary with the specific commodity. In general, freshness,\\nuniformity of size, variety, colour, degree of ripeness and freedom from defects are the qualities most\\nfrequently sought. When purchasing, select fresh vegetables and fruits, which are firm, crisp, bright in\\ncolour, with no visible bruises or signs of decay and wilting.\\n\\n\\n\\n218218218218218 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nAt the peak of season, each vegetable and fruit has the highest nutrient content, flavour and is\\navailable at a reasonable price. It is therefore advisable to buy vegetables and fruits which are in season,\\nas the quality is high and the price low.\\n\\nLeafy Vegetables include all sags or keerai such as amaranth, bathua, coriander, fenugreek (methi),\\nspinach (palak) colocasia leaves, mint and mustard. Dark green, leafy vegetables are good sources of\\nminerals, iron and calcium, and vitamin A, C and some of the B-complex vitamins.\\n\\nSelect clean leafy vegetables, which are tender, crisp, brightly coloured and free from flowers,\\ninsects, mud and spots or holes in the leaves. In head vegetables, such as cabbage, the hard, heavy and\\ncompact heads free from bruises and worm injury are a good buy.\\n\\nOther Vegetables include stems, fruit vegetables such as brinjals, cucumber, all gourds, pumpkin,\\nladies finger, pepper, tomatoes, pods such as cluster beans, french beans, immature seeds-corn, wal,\\nchawali and peas, cauliflower and all other vegetables, which are not included in the groups leafy or\\nroots and tubers.\\n\\nGenerally tender, firm, crisp, bright coloured vegetables free from worm injury, are selected and\\ntoo mature, dry, wilted, shrunken, shrivelled discoloured vegetables are rejected. Small or medium-\\nsized vegetables are likely to be more tender and less fibrous in texture than large and too mature ones.\\nEach vegetables is selected according to the preparation in which it is to be used. For example, tomatoes\\nused for salads need to be large and fleshy; small and medium-sized ones can be used in mixed vegetables\\nor stews.\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nMany fruits are used as vegetables, e.g., cucumber, tomatoes, etc. What we eat as fruit is normally\\nseedbearing parts of plants, which consist of edible tissue, which is juicy, pulpy and sweet or sweet-\\nsour in taste and mature seed or seeds enclosed in it. Most ripe fruits can be eaten as such. Fruits have\\ndelicate, delectable flavours and aroma and attractive colour and texture. Most fruits are enjoyed by all\\ngroups and at all times either as an appetiser, a snack or as a dessert. Fruits are important sources of\\nminerals and vitamins. Deep orange-yellow varieties are important as sources of pro-vitamin A (beta-\\ncarotene). Amla, guavas, citrus fruits, pineapple, are rich sources of vitamin C. In purchasing fruits, it\\nis necessary to learn to judge the appropriate size and colour for the kind and variety of fruit, as these\\nare indicators of the high quality of the fruit and its maturity. As with vegetables, fresh fruits are best\\nat the peak of the season, as the flavour and nutrient content is high and prices competitive.\\n\\nCitrus Fruits: Select mature, firm, just ripe, thin skinned, heavy in relation to size fruit, which is\\nfree from blemishes, bruises, soft spots. Citrus fruits include oranges, sweet limes (mausambi), grape\\nfruits, pomoloe, lemons, etc. These are sorted according to size and the price decreases with the size.\\nThese are sold per dozen or per basket, which contain two to six dozen of larger fruits and hundred of\\nsmaller fruits. In some markets lemons are sold by weight. Citrus fruits which are thin skinned, firm,\\nand heavy in relation to size are preferred, as these are likely to contain more juice. Cirtus fruits are\\nvalued for their taste and refreshing flavour and add to the appetising quality of fruit salads and fruit\\ncocktails.\\n\\nBananas: A number of varieties—green, yellow and red are normally available throughout the\\nyear. Each one has its own characteristic flavour. Of these green ones are more common than the other\\ntwo. The bunch is plucked when it starts ripening on the tree. It is better to purchase bananas which\\nare free from bruises and slightly hard and then allow them to ripen at room temperature, as fully ripe\\nfruit is easily bruised even as you carry it home from the market. Shelf-life of green bananas is very\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Selection, Purchase and Storage 219219219219219\\n\\nshort after ripening. Ripe fruit does not store well in the refrigerator, as the sugar to starch conversion\\nis favoured at low temperature.\\n\\nSome varieties of yellow bananas (such as velachi) can be stored for two to three days after\\nripening and are not easily bruised, and are a good buy, when available.\\n\\nApples are now available throughout the year, as these are now held in cold storage. Good apples\\nare firm, crisp, well coloured and heavy. Each variety has its own characteristic colour and shape.\\nApples become mealy, have less flavour and taste, when stored too long. Hence, it is advisable to buy\\napples only in season. The red and golden apples are suitable for serving as such, while small, tart fruits\\nare suitable for making jelly, sauce and pies. Grapes should be plump, shiny, well coloured, firmly\\nattached to stem, free from discolouration and bruises.\\n\\nRemember not to, refrigerate bananas, pineapples, papayas and avocadoes, as these fruits undergo\\nundesirable changes in texture and flavour at refrigerator temperature. Most other fruits keep well,\\nwhen refrigerated.\\n\\nMilk and Milk Products\\n\\nMilk: Fresh milk has a slightly sweetish odour and flavour, is white in colour and has a faintly\\nacid reaction to litmus. Stale milk has a sour odour and flavour. Fresh cow’s and buffalo’s milk is sold\\nthrough home delivery or dairies. It is advisable to boil fresh milk before use.\\n\\nPasteurised Milk: In the larger cities, pasteurised milk is distributed by government, semi-\\ngovernment, co-operative or private agencies. The milk is pasteurised, bottled or put into plastic packets\\nand sold. The price of the milk is indirectly related to the amount of fat present. Major part of the\\npasteurised, milk sold through Government channels is defatted to varying degrees. As the fat separated\\nis sold after conversion to butter, it helps to reduce the price of the milk.\\n\\nButter: Butter is made from milk cream. It contains 11 to 16 per cent moisture. It has a delicate\\nflavour and has a short shelf-life at room temperature. Processed butter keeps up to two weeks in the\\nrefrigerator. Home-made fresh butter contains more moisture and therefore has a shorter shelf-life than\\nprocessed butter.\\n\\nPaneer: Paneer is coagulated milk protein with high moisture content. It should be used immediately\\nafter purchase. It should be bought from clean hygienic dairies or made at home.\\n\\nKhoya or Mava is prepared from milk by evaporation of water. Fresh khoya has a sweet delicate\\naroma and taste. Stale khoya has a rancid odour and a flat taste.\\n\\nEggs, Poultry, Fish and Meat\\n\\nEggs: A fresh egg has a small aircell, which can be observed against a light or a candle. Eggs are\\nsorted according to size. Large eggs are preferred for table use. When eggs are used in preparation,\\nsize is not important and selection is made in terms of price in relation to size. It is advisable to purchase\\nfresh, clean and unbroken eggs.\\n\\nPoultry: In poultry, there is a relatively high proportion of waste from live weight to edible\\nportion. Edible portion is only about 55 per cent of live weight. Selection is made on the basis of\\nintended use of the poultry. Good quality poultry is full fleshed, meaty and has a good layer of fat. The\\nskin is smooth, without tears and discolouration or pin feathers. Poultry which is dressed, should be\\nproperly refrigerated.\\n\\nIn a young bird, the skin and breast-bone are pliable, soft and tear easily. Older birds have hard\\ncalcified breast-bone and may have a lot of long hair. Weight is not necessarily related to the age of the\\n\\n\\n\\n220220220220220 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nbird. In young birds sex difference is not significant, but older male birds are less fatty and are inferior\\nin flavour to female birds.\\n\\nFish: Fresh fish has firm flesh, a stiff body and tight scales. If you press the body, no indentation\\nis left. If placed in water, fresh fish sinks; stale fish is flabby; has sunken and dull eyes, scales are easily\\nbrushed off, gills are not bright red and has a state or sour odour. Select fresh fish, which have red gills\\nand bright eyes. Be sure to purchase fish, which has been refrigerated or stored on ice, and is not\\nslippery or slimy to touch.\\n\\nSelect fish according to intended use, e.g., whole fish or fillet for baking; steaks for boiling or\\nfrying. Frozen fish should be frozen solid when purchased, and should have no odour. It should be\\nwrapped in water proof packaging material. It should be kept frozen until use.\\n\\nMeat: Meat is selected on the basis of conformation or form, finish and quality.\\nConformation or form refers to the shape or build of the animal. Good form consists of short,\\n\\nthick, compact build, with large muscles, which have high proportion of meat to bone. Finish indicates\\nthe amount and distribution of fat. An even larger of fat on the outside of the carcass and even\\ndistribution of fat in the lean part are indicators of a good finish. In good quality meat (i) lean meat is\\nbright red in colour, when cut surface is exposed to air; (ii) it is fine grained and smooth to touch,\\n(iii) the fat is firm, brittle and creamy white in colour.\\n\\nDark colour, coarse grain, low fat content uneven distribution and yellow-orange colour of fat\\nand soft texture are indicators of poor quality meat. In India lamb and mutton are used widely. Lamb is\\nsheep’s flesh up to the age of one year. When the sheep is more than one year old, its flesh is called\\nmutton.\\n\\nPork is flesh of pig. The best quality of pork has muscle that is grayish white to pink in young and\\ndeep rose in older animals. The flesh is firm and fine grained and the bones are soft and red. It has a\\nminimum of fat. Lower quality pork is heavier and contains more fat. Pork could contain a parasitic\\nroundworm of microscopic size which produces a disease called trichinosis. It is, therefore, rec-\\nommended that pork be always well cooked before being eaten, as cooking at high temperatures\\ndestroys this organism.\\n\\nMeat prices vary according to the cut, quality and kind. Selection is made according to the\\nintended use in preparation. Generally, the amount of meat purchased is 60 g uncooked boneless meat\\nper person and 100 g, if it contains bones. The meat should be bought from a clean and hygienic shop\\nand should be free from bad odour. Meat should be refrigerated after slaughter, until it is sold. Slime on\\nthe surface of meat indicates deterioration.\\n\\nStorage of Food\\n\\nProper storage of food, that is produced at home or purchased for the family is an important part\\nof meeting the food needs of the family. It is necessary to decide about what to store and how to store\\nafter considering the space available and the shelf-life of the foods.\\n\\nOn the basis of their stability during storage, foods have been divided into non-perishable, semi-\\nperishable and perishable foods. Table 18.2 gives a list of common foods classified according to their\\nstability during storage at room temperature. It may be noted that cereals, dals, legumes, which have\\nbeen dried to less than 13 per cent moisture are non-perishable if stored in a cool, dry place.\\n\\nThe foods, which can be stored for a week to a couple of months, at room temperature without\\nthe occurrence of undesirable changes in flavour and texture can  be termed as semi-perishable foods.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Selection, Purchase and Storage 221221221221221\\n\\nThese include, baked foods, roasted, popped or toasted cereals and legumes, ground flours and some\\nfruits and vegetables. Most of the fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, meat, fish, poultry are perishable\\nfoods. Their storage life varies from a few hours to a few days, depending on their composition and\\ntemperature and humidity at which these are stored.\\n\\nUsually cereals (e.g., wheat, rice), millets (bajra), corn (makka), jowar legumes, nuts, oilseeds,\\noil, sugar, salt, etc., are some of the foods, which can be bought in bulk and stored. The quantities\\nstored by a family depends on size of the family and the space available for storage. It also depends on\\nthe marketing facilities available and the monetary and other resources of the family.\\n\\nIn rural areas, people store a year’s supply of cereals, dals, ground-nuts, jaggery, sugar, spices,\\nsalt, tamarind, etc. There are several reasons for this practice. The best material is available in harvest\\nseason at a reasonable rate. After the season, the rate fluctuates considerably. Many articles are out of\\nstock after the harvest season, or, if available, the quality is poor.\\n\\nIn large cities the trend is quite different. The storage space may be limited. Salaried persons find\\nit easier to buy on a monthly or fortnightly basis. The marketing facilities are relatively stable and\\nstoring enough groceries for a fortnight or a month is adequate.\\n\\nTable 18.2: Storage Life of Foods at 25°C\\n\\nFood Non-perishable Semi-perishable Perishable\\nGroup\\n\\nI Dals, split, legumes, Flours of dals, roasted Cooked dals and legumes,\\nwhole, nuts and oilseeds, dals, roasted nuts and wet-ground mixes (e.g., idli mix)\\ndry salted fish and meat oil-seeds, eggs milk, fresh dahi, butter-milk,\\n\\nkhoya,\\ncheese, meat, poultry, fish\\n\\nII (a) Nil Nil All foods in this group\\nII (b) Pickled mango, pickled Citrus fruits–oranges Amla, guava cashew\\n\\nlemons and other citrus lemons, sweet limes, apple, pineapple, tomato\\nfruits grape fruits\\n\\nIII Nil Apples, apricots, Peas, beans, brinjals,\\npumpkin, ashgourd roots carrots\\nand tubers, yams,\\npotatoes, onions\\n\\nIV Whole cereals and millets, Biscuits, cakes, rawa Bread, roti, chapati rice or\\ndry cereal products (suji), cereal flours, rice other cooked cereals\\n\\nflakes, popped cereals\\n\\nV Sugar, Jaggery, Mithais Butter, cream\\nhydrogenated fat,\\nvanaspati, oil, ghee\\n\\nStorage of Non-perishable Foods\\n\\nDals, whole legumes, most of the whole pulses, oilseeds, etc., can be cleaned to remove stones,\\nsand and any other foreign matter and washed with water to remove any dust and dirt adhering to the\\n\\n\\n\\n222222222222222 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ngrains. Then these may be dried in the sun. After drying, the food materials should be allowed to cool,\\nbefore being put in containers for storage.\\n\\nUsually dry foods are stored in tins, which have tight-fitting lids. Spices and murrabbas are\\nstored in battles and pickles in glass, earthenware or porcelain containers.\\n\\nWhatever the material of the container, it is important to wash it with hot water and soap and any\\nmatter adhering to it should be scrubbed with a brush or coconut fibre. Next it should be allowed to\\ndry, preferably in the sun. If any wiping is necessary, it should be done with a clean cloth.\\n\\nConvenient Arrangements: Some houses have a separate storeroom. Some have a closet like\\nspace attached to the kitchen for storage. Some build a large storage cupboard in the kitchen itself.\\n\\nSome storerooms are fitted with wall cupboards and these are convenient for storage. Others\\nhave cement shelves. If neither arrangement is in existence, wooden shelves can be made, which work\\nwell for storage.\\n\\nTo facilitate cleaning of the floor, it is better to have the lowest shelf about six to eight inches\\nabove the floor. The heaviest containers should be placed on the lowest shelf. Wherever two rows are\\nplaced, taller containers should be kept at the back and the smaller ones in front, so that it is easy to\\nreach both.\\n\\nUsing clean ladles to remove the food from the large containers helps in getting a known amount\\nand avoids spilling.\\n\\nIt is good to keep a few blank cards in the storeroom and note the amounts bought and used with\\ndates. This helps to get an accurate idea of the amounts used. It also gives a fair idea of overall nutrition\\nof the family. An idea of the actual usage of articles helps in making a realistic budget. One added\\nbenefit is that any pilferage of food is quickly noticed.\\n\\nIn many city houses, there is no separate storeroom. So it is necessary to fit up storage shelves\\nin the kitchen. In this situation, it is important to put the shelves as far away from the cooking area as\\npossible, because cooking results in heating up the air around the stove (or any other cooking device—\\ngas or sigree). This frequent increase in temperature encourages the growth of moths and weevils in\\nthe food. Also, when  air is heated, the moisture from the air is condensed, making nearby objects\\ndamp. This, too, aids the growth of moths and weevils. Therefore, the storage shelves should be\\nlocated in a cool and dry corner of the kitchen.\\n\\nIn most rural households, cereals are stored in earthenware containers or containers made of\\nbamboo and plastered with mud or cow-dung. These are improvised storage structures made from\\nindigenous materials. Cereals after harvest and drying are stored in these containers and covered with\\ndried-hay or straws. These storage structures are however susceptible to attack by rodents and\\nconsequently some losses of stored foodgrains occur. Pulses, spices, tamarind, etc., are also usually\\nstored in earthenware pots or jugs.\\n\\nFor bulk-storage of foodgrains usually maintained by wholesale traders. State Trading Corporations,\\nCentral Warehouses, Food Corporation of India, the foodgrains are stored in gunny-bags (jute bags) in\\npiles in big godowns usually made rat-proof. These godowns are to be properly ventilated, periodically\\nfumigated and kept free from water-logging to prevent dampening of stored commodities.\\n\\nStorage of Semi-perishable Foods\\n\\nWhen cereals, dals and legumes (including groundnuts) are subject to any processing such as\\ngrinding, roasting, baking or frying, their high quality storage life is reduced depending upon the storage\\ntemperature and relative humidity (presence of moisture in the air).\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Selection, Purchase and Storage 223223223223223\\n\\nThe flours, suji, rice flakes (chewda), roasted dals, etc., which have a moisture content less than\\n13 per cent are stored in the same manner as cereals and pulses described above. Flour and Semolina\\n(suji) spoil faster than whole grain, because the insects can use these foods more easily. When rice\\nflakes or popcorn is made some flavour compounds are formed, which are responsible for the\\ncharacteristic flavour. These are slowly lost during storage, thus these products become less palatable,\\nas the period of storage increases. It is therefore better to use such products within a few weeks of\\nproduction to ensure high quality.\\n\\nApples, citrus fruits, some gourds and root vegetables keep well in a cool storeroom, cellar or\\nbasement. Suitable temperature for storage of these fruits and vegetables is around 15°C. Table 18.3\\ngives optimal temperatures and relative humidity for storage of raw foods.\\n\\nTable 18.3: Optimal Temperature and Relative Humidity for Storage of Raw Foods\\n\\nProduct (foods) Temperature Relative Humidity\\n(°C) %\\n\\nBananas 12–16 85–90\\n\\nBeans, peppers 7 85–90\\n\\nCabbage, lettuce, carrots 0 90–95\\n\\nLemons 13–14 85–90\\n\\nMelons 4–10 80–85\\n\\nNuts 0–02 65–70\\n\\nOnions 0 70–75\\n\\nTomatoes (ripe) 4–10 85–90\\n\\nStorage of Perishable Foods\\n\\nFoods spoil due to the action of enzymes and microorganisms (moulds, yeasts and bacteria) in\\nthem. Actual spoilage is usually quite easily noticed by the presence of rancid odour flavour of fats\\n(caused by oxidation), fermented odour of fruit or fruit juices due to yeast growth, or the appearance\\nof mould growth on bread, roti or cooked rice. Slime on the surface of meats, or sour taste in bland\\nfoods may be caused by bacterial action.\\n\\nLow temperatures retard spoilage and other changes in the quality of perishable foods\\n(Figure 18.1). The action of enzymes and the growth of spoilage organisms is slowed down by low\\ntemperature storage. Perishable foods include most of the fresh vegetables and fruits and animal protein\\nfoods such as milk, eggs, meat, fish and poultry.\\n\\nVegetables and Fruits continue to respire after they are harvested. Harvesting disturbs the normal\\nlife processes, and vegetables start losing their vitality, turgidity and food value. The harvested vegetables\\ncontinue to respire during transport and storage. This involves the using of oxygen, the metabolism of\\ncell food materials, and the release of carbon dioxide, water and energy. Most of the energy is released\\nin the form of heat. The process of respiration must be slowed during storage, by control of temperature\\nand relative humidity.\\n\\n\\n\\n224224224224224 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 18.1: Refrigeration—a low temperature storage of perishable foods.\\n\\nPlant (vegetable) tissues change during storage. These changes include loss of water, modification\\nof the fibres, and change in the pectins. The loss of water is reduced by storing vegetables in an\\natmosphere of high relative humidity. Removing the tops of radishes, carrots and onions, reduces loss\\nof moisture, due to decrease in surface area. Peas in pods keep better than when shelled. Peas and corn\\nbecome less palatable during storage due to sugar being converted to starch. It is better to buy these\\nvegetables only in the quantity needed for immediate use. Succulent vegetables should be kept cold in\\na dampened cloth or in a covered ventilated container. Roots and tubers may be stored in a cool,\\nventilated place the storage temperature being maintained between 3 and 10°C (38–50°F) — to keep\\nsprouting to a minimum. Only sound vegetables should be selected and stored; even a few bruised\\ntubers may contaminate the entire lot.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Selection, Purchase and Storage 225225225225225\\n\\nLeafy and other vegetables and fruits start  ageing soon after harvest. The crispness and flavour\\nof green leafy vegetables deteriorate as water evaporates from it. These changes related to ageing are\\nretarded by low temperature storage.\\n\\nLeafy and other vegetables tend to shrivel and become unpalatable when stored uncovered in the\\nrefrigerator. Most refrigerators provide at least one covered container called a ‘crisper’ for storage of\\nvegetables and fruits. Use of plastic bags for storage of clean dry vegetables and fruits, retards the\\nevaporation of moisture from them.\\n\\nMilk: Deterioration starts soon after the collection of milk. It is necessary to retard the changes\\nduring storage, so that there is minimal loss of quality prior to the preparation and use. Some of the\\nsteps taken to ensure quality during storage of these foods are discussed here.\\n\\nMilk is normally boiled in Indian homes, as soon as it is brought to the kitchen and stored in\\ncovered containers. Boiling destroys spoilage organisms and also the enzymes present in milk. Thus\\nboiling helps to store milk in good condition for 12–24 hours, at room temperature. Milk is converted\\nto curd by inoculating it with buttermilk containing lactics. The conversion to curd and buttermilk,\\nhelps to extend the storage period of milk by 24 hours. The storage life can be further extended by\\nstorage in the refrigerator. Butter and cheese are also perishable products of which the storage period\\ncan be extended to two weeks, by refrigeration.\\n\\nFish, Meat Poultry: Fresh fish, meat, poultry can be kept for short periods at temperatures just\\nabove freezing. Ground meat is more likely to spoil than roasts, chops, steaks, due to (i) the handling,\\n(ii) exposure of larger surface to air, and (iii) equipments. Organ meats such as liver, kidney, brain are\\nalso more perishable than other cuts.\\n\\nOxidation of fats in meats produces off-flavours and oxidation of meat pigments causes\\ndiscolouration. Both these are undesirable changes, which can  be retarded by storing meat in the\\ncoldest part of the refrigerator. The fats in pork and poultry are more easily oxidised than others.\\nTherefore, it is recommended that these meats be held for very short periods, prior to use.\\n\\nShell Eggs should be refrigerated promptly. Flavour and quality changes occur rapidly if eggs are\\nheld at room temperature, but very slowly at refrigerator temperature.\\n\\nStudy Questions and Activities\\n\\n1.

The study of food\\npreparation involves understanding the changes that occur in these components during preparation as\\na result of their interaction with one another, with the medium of cooking, the temperature of cooking\\nand the environment.\\n\\nFood preparation is an important step in meeting the nutritional needs of the family. It is not\\nenough that food be nutritious, it has to be pleasing in appearance and taste so that it is eaten. Good\\npreparation is an important prerequisite of food acceptance. Therefore, it is important to acquire the\\nability to prepare and serve food, which is nutritious and acceptable to the family. The science of food\\npreparation is based on the understanding of physical and chemical changes that occur in food during\\npreparation.\\n\\nThis knowledge can be used to combine food ingredients in diverse ways to prepare innumerable\\ncombinations with delicate flavours, textures, and colour, which delight the senses. Thus food preparation\\nis both a science and an art. Food preparation is very much a part of the culture of the region. Each\\nregion has its own methods of blending flavours to bring about acceptable combinations.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Preparation 227227227227227\\n\\nReasons for Cooking Foods\\n\\nMost foods are acceptable only when they are cooked. Except for some fruits and vegetables,\\nmost of the food we eat is cooked. Even the tea or coffee or milk we take in the morning and the bread\\nwe take with it involves some manner of cooking. For centuries we have nurtured this art of cooking.\\nLet us see why we cook food.\\n\\nFigure 19.1: Food preparation.\\n\\nOne of the foremost reasons for cooking is that it improves taste. Cooking does improve the taste\\nof as simple a food as rice. It also makes the food more palatable. The sight of a raw potato may not\\neven attract a hungry person but the sight of potato chips allures us to sample a few even when we are\\nnot hungry. Thus cooking helps to enhance the taste and flavour of food and makes it more appetising.\\n\\nA number of desirable changes occur in foods during cooking. For instance vegetables become\\nsoft. Starchy foods like cereals and dals take up water, swell and soften.\\n\\nFood preparation is very much a part of the culture of the region. Each region has its own\\nmethods of blending flavours to bring about acceptable combinations. Spices and condiments are\\nadded to the food and the food is simmered until the flavours blend. Some foods are also seasoned with\\nheated oil in which some of the spices are fried. These steps help to blend the flavours of the ingredients\\nand thus enhance the acceptability of the product.\\n\\nAs cooking involves heating of foods, many microorganisms are destroyed, during the course of\\ncooking. This renders the food safe for eating. For example, boiling milk results in killing pathogens\\nlike tubercle bacilli if these are present; spoilage organisms are also killed by heating milk. Therefore\\nheated milk keeps longer than unheated milk. Some of the toxins present in the foods are rendered\\ninactive at the cooking temperature. Thus cooking helps to remove heat-labile toxins.\\n\\nCooking food helps to provide unlimited variety in the menu. Thus with the same raw foods it is\\npossible to provide innumerable dishes, which makes eating a pleasure.\\n\\nCooked food is easily chewed and swallowed. It is easily acted on by digestive juices. This makes\\nits passage through the digestive tract smooth. In this manner, cooking improves the digestibility of\\nfood.\\n\\n\\n\\n228228228228228 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nQuality of Food\\n\\nThe condition of the food when it is brought into the kitchen determines the nature of the final\\ncooked product. Foods bought must be of good quality. Conditions of storage should be such that the\\nquality does not deteriorate during storage. Vegetable that have been stored too long, milk and milk\\nproducts that have deteriorated (i.e., dahi which is sour) and oils that are flat or rancid cannot improve\\nin the preparation. This does not mean that one must buy the most expensive foods in the market. But\\nit does mean that one must buy good quality food. Expensive foods need not necessarily be of good\\nquality.\\n\\nPreliminary Treatment of Foods\\n\\nOnly clean food is palatable. Food should be washed to remove surface dirt. Each food needs to\\nbe handled carefully to ensure removal of adhering dirt without damaging its form and structure, and\\ncausing loss of nutrients.\\n\\nPreliminary treatment of food includes washing, cleaning, peeling, cutting, slicing, grating, soaking,\\ngerminating, fermenting, roasting, grinding or some other step.\\n\\nThese procedures have to be carefully planned for each food so that the natural flavour and\\ntexture are retained. Table 19.1 lists the type of preliminary treatments of various foods prior to\\npreparation.\\n\\nTable 19.1: Preliminary Treatment of Foods\\n\\nPreliminary Treatment Foods\\n\\nWashing Vegetables, fruits, whole grains\\n\\nPeeling, cutting, slicing, grating, cubing Vegetables and fruits\\n\\nPounding/milling/grinding Cereals, legumes, spices, nuts\\n\\nSoaking Rice, dals, legumes\\n\\nFermenting Cereals, dals and their mixtures\\n\\nGerminating Cereals and legumes\\n\\nRoasting Whole cereals, legumes, nuts, semolina,\\nspices, etc.\\n\\nMixing All ingredients in preparations\\n\\nKneading Flours for breads, chapatis, puri, etc.\\n\\nThe pre-preparation steps mentioned above need to be carried out in such a manner that nutrient\\nloss is minimised. For example, while washing rice and dal to remove external dirt, care must be taken\\nnot to scrub the grain, which may lead to unnecessary loss of water-soluble nutrients. Vegetables and\\nfruits must be cut into even pieces, which are symmetrical and convey a sense of order. Some fruits\\ndarken on cutting and peeling, e.g., apples. It may not be necessary to peel these. It is advisable to cut\\nsuch fruits just before use (Figure 19.2).\\n\\nVegetables and fruits need to be drained after washing, to reduce spoilage. Soaking rice, dal and\\nwhole legumes before cooking may result in reduced cooking time and improved texture.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Preparation 229229229229229\\n\\nIn short, care and planning in preliminary handling is essential to prepare an acceptable finished\\nproduct. Poor preliminary treatment cannot be corrected later.\\n\\nFigure 19.2: Steps in food preparation.\\n\\nSeasoning\\n\\nSome foods require no seasoning. Others are improved by addition of small amounts of seasoning\\nmaterials. The purpose of seasoning is to enhance the flavour of the food and to make it more delectable.\\nSeasoning should be used judiciously so that it blends with the food flavour and is not excessive.\\n\\nFood Preparation Techniques\\n\\nGood food preparation requires understanding of the composition and structure of food and the\\nchanges that take place during preparation. Basic principles must be observed for each group of food\\nproducts to obtain good results. Skill in handling foods is acquired by applying knowledge of cooking\\nprinciples. Some techniques are more difficult to master than others; e.g., making an attractive salad is\\neasier than preparing vegetable cutlets.\\n\\nFigure 19.3: Utensils used in food preparation.\\n\\nIn addition good equipment used scientifically helps to achieve good results in food preparation\\n(Figs. 19.1, 19.3, 19.4, 19.5, 19.6). Knowledge of the correct recipe, which indicates the proportion of\\n\\nWashing\\n\\nPeeling\\n\\nCutting\\n\\n\\n\\n230230230230230 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nvarious ingredients and the order and method of combining these helps to ensure a good product. As\\nbooks which give basic proportions and recipes of Indian dishes are few, one has to record one’s own\\nrecipes and improve or modify them to create variety.\\n\\nThe magic ingredient in food preparation is imagination. It is the ability to visualise the effect of\\nchange in ingredients on the recipe in terms of flavour, texture and colour. As in any other art, practice\\nis essential but the practice must be intelligently directed. To be proficient in food preparation skills, one\\nmust make efforts to observe carefully those who are proficient in food preparation and get opportunities\\nto handle food. The chance to organise and prepare dishes for parties at home, for the class and for\\nfriends help to develop one’s skills and creative abilities. It must be remembered that foods are most\\npalatable and nutritious when served soon after preparation.\\n\\nFigure 19.4: Grinding stone.\\n\\nIt is necessary to think of how the foods combine in terms of colour, flavour and texture.\\nPleasing combinations increase the appeal of a meal. Here again, one can make innumerable combinations\\nfrom the same ingredients if one uses one’s experience and imagination.\\n\\nMethods of Food Preparation\\n\\nEach food item can be prepared into several different dishes. The methods of cooking of these\\nitems, however, are not many. The method used depends on the kind of product desired and the\\ningredients available.\\n\\nDesirable appearance, colour, texture, flavour, odour and moisture must be retained or produced\\nin the course of preparation. To achieve these ends, it is necessary to understand the methods used in\\nthe preparation of food.\\n\\nChoice of Fuel\\n\\nBefore we proceed with discussing the methods of cooking let us try to understand how heat\\nenergy, which is necessary for all forms of cooking, is produced. The heat for cooking is usually\\ngenerated by the use of kerosene, gas, electricity, charcoal, wood or sawdust as fuel. The choice of\\nfuel depends on the availability and the comparative cost of various fuels. Ease with which the fuel\\nignites and is put off and safety in use are also important considerations in the choice of fuel. Fuels,\\nwhich can be converted into heat energy without production of offensive by-products and leave none\\nor minimum residue, are preferred as they are economic and convenient to use.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Preparation 231231231231231\\n\\nFigure 19.5: Food preparation equipment.\\n\\nFigure 19.6: Food preparation equipment.\\n\\nBy these criteria the fuels may be listed in the order of preference thus cooking gas, electricity,\\nkerosene, charcoal, sawdust and wood. In practice, two more factors may affect our choice, availability\\nand cost.\\n\\nMedium of Food Preparation\\n\\nThe methods of cooking can be classified on the basis of the medium used for heat transfer. The\\nmedia normally used are water as such or in the form of steam, oil and air.\\n\\nWater\\nWater is most commonly used medium of cooking. Boiling, simmering and stewing are methods\\n\\nin which moist heat is used. Many of the foods are cooked by using a combination of these methods.\\n\\n\\n\\n232232232232232 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nBoiling: The food is washed, covered with an adequate quantity of water and heated to boiling.\\nThe intensity of heat is then reduced to keep the food simmering till done. The temperature of boiling\\nwater is usually 100°C and when it simmers, the temperature may range from 85 to 90°C. If the food\\nis boiled continuously water is evaporated quickly, the structure and texture of the food product is\\naffected adversely (damaged) and the loss of heat-labile nutrients is increased. The continuous boiling\\nof food results in wastage of fuel also. Normally, boiling followed by simmering is used in food\\npreparation. Soups and broths are normally prepared by this method.\\n\\nSimmering and poaching are used to cook food by immersion in a liquid maintained at just below\\nthe boiling point (85°C–90ºC) so that bubbles form slowly and collapse below the surface. As mentioned\\nearlier, most foods are brought to boil and allowed to simmer till done. Milk preparations such as\\nKadhi, Kheer are prepared by simmering.\\n\\nStewing refers to simmering food in a small quantity of liquid. The temperature of stewing is the\\nsame as that of simmering. The food is stewed when the finished product is intended to contain a small\\namount of liquid. Most of the vegetables and meats are prepared by this method.\\n\\nFoods cooked with water as the medium are heated by transfer of heat energy from the fuel\\nthrough the container to the water. Water is heated both by conduction and convection currents. The\\ntime needed for cooking the food is thus dependent on the amount of food being cooked, the material,\\nthickness and size of the container and the efficiency of the fuel used.\\n\\nIf the food is cooked in just enough water, it is necessary to reduce the heat, keep a watchful eye\\nand remove the food from the stove as soon as it is done to avoid burning the bottom layer of the food.\\n\\nThe cooking of food with water as a medium will be affected by the quantity of dissolved\\nsubstances in it because the boiling point of water is elevated in the presence of solutes. At high\\naltitudes water boils at a lower temperature than at sea level and therefore cooking may take a longer\\ntime than at sea level.\\n\\nTable 19.2: Temperatures Used for Cooking\\n\\nMethod of cooking Approximate temperature\\n\\nSimmering/stewing 95°–90°C\\n\\nBoiling/steaming 100°C\\n\\nPressure cooking 110–112°C\\n\\nBaking 110°C–205°C1\\n\\nDeep fat frying 180–220°C\\n\\n1.  The temperature attained by the food is only about 43°C\\n\\nSteam\\nSteaming of food also involves the use of moist heat. When food is cooked in water vapour with\\n\\nor without pressure it is said to be steamed. The water vapour is produced from water placed at the\\nbottom of the pan. Some of the products that are prepared by steaming are idli, khaman-dhokla,\\nmodak, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Preparation 233233233233233\\n\\nPressure Cooking: When steam under pressure is used the method is known as pressure cooking and\\nthe equipment used is known as a pressure cooker. As the temperature is elevated quickly in the food\\ncooked with steam under pressure, the cooking period is reduced as also the loss of heat-labile nutrients.\\nIn this method, heat is transferred from the steam to the food; the steam condenses on the cold food\\nand heat is released. Condensation of the steam occurs until the food reaches the temperature of steam\\n(100°C); then the condensation decreases and steam pressure is built-up in the pressure cooker, to the\\npoint desired. Rice, dal, some pieces of meat, potatoes and other roots and tubers, and various types of\\nbeans, and peas and some gourds are cooked in the pressure cooker.\\n\\nSteam cooked foods are light, fluffy and easily digestible. As the period of cooking is reduced,\\nthe loss of heat-labile nutrients is minimised and there is saving of fuel and time. As the steaming of\\nfood does not need constant attention as in simmering or stewing, the time saved can be used for other\\nactivities such as preparing salad, chapati or dessert.\\n\\nOil or Fat\\n\\nOil or fat is used as a medium of cooking in pan-frying and deep fat frying. Pan-frying or shallow\\nfrying is the cooking of food in a lightly greased pan, e.g., dosai, thalipeeth, fried egg, pancake, puda,\\netc. The heat is transferred mainly by conduction to the food. Only a thin layer of mix or thin pieces of\\nfood are cooked in this manner. The food must be turned from one side to another to ensure complete\\ncooking.\\n\\nDeep fat frying is similar to boiling. The fat is heated by conduction of heat from the frying pan;\\nthe heat is then distributed by convection currents through the fat. The food is cooked very quickly by\\nthis method as the fats can be heated to much higher temperatures than boiling water. Therefore, it\\nneeds constant and careful attention. The temperature of frying varies from 180–220°C depending on\\nthe oil or fat used as a frying medium and food preparation being made. It is important to choose fats\\nwith high smoking temperature as the frying medium. Fats and oils should not be heated to the smoking\\npoint1 as at this temperature the fat starts decomposing, and is not suitable for frying foods.\\n\\nFrying imparts a special flavour and texture to the foods making it tender or crunchy. There is an\\nincrease in the energy value of the food when it is fried. The high temperature used destroys any\\npathogens present on the surface.\\n\\nThese foods are not digested quickly, due to the fat absorbed in frying. This method is not\\nsuitable for tough cuts of meat. It is used to make puries, pakoras, samosas, chips cutlets, etc.\\n\\nAir (dry heat)\\nMethods in which air is used as a principal cooking medium include roasting, baking, broiling and\\n\\ngrilling.\\nRoasting means to cook food by dry heat without covering it. Food is roasted or baked on heated\\n\\nmetal, on stones or under hot coals, in hot ashes and/or in an oven.\\nFoods prepared by this method include chapati, roti, nan, and other unleavened breads, potatoes,\\n\\nsweet potatoes, other tubers, jowar, corn, paddy, groundnuts, cashewnuts, walnuts, pistachios, etc.\\nBaking is also cooking by dry heat in an oven or oven-like appliance, covered or uncovered\\n\\ncontainers may be used for baking. The food placed in the oven, to bake or roast may be partially\\n\\n1. Smoking-point of fat is the temperature at which decomposition starts with emission of blue smoke, which\\nis irritating.\\n\\n\\n\\n234234234234234 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ncooked by dry heat, by the convection currents of hot dry air and conduction of heat from the container\\nto the food and partially by moist heat. Hot sand baths are used in baking on top of the stove. In this\\nimprovised method, the baking dish is placed in the sand bath, which is then covered to prevent loss of\\nheat. Bread, cakes, pies, pastries are examples of baked products. The temperatures attained in different\\nmethods are given in Table 19.2.\\n\\nBroiling or grilling refers to cooking of food by exposing it to direct heat. The food is cooked in\\npart by contact with the hot broiler (conduction) and partially due to the radiant heat energy. Grilled\\nsandwiches are an example of this method of cooking.\\n\\nCombination of Methods\\n\\nMany food preparation are made by using a combination of methods. When we roast semolina\\nbefore putting it in boiling water for preparing upma or season vegetables with oil and spices and then\\nadd water, two cooking media—air and water, fat and water are used. It may be noted that many food\\npreparations are made by using more than one method of heat transfer.\\n\\nSudy Questions and Practical Activities\\n\\n1. List the reasons for cooking food.\\n2.

It is necessary\\nto understand and manipulate the changes to obtain an acceptable food product.\\n\\nThe major constituents of food are carbohydrates, proteins, fats and their derivatives and water.\\nIn addition, a number of inorganic mineral components and a diverse group of organic substances are\\npresent in very small amounts in foods. These include pigments, flavour components, vitamins, acids,\\nenzymes, etc. Let us consider their properties and the changes that occur in these components during\\nhandling, cooking and processing.\\n\\nCarbohydrates\\n\\nStarch, sugars, pectins, gums, celluloses and hemicelluloses are the important carbohydrates\\nfound in foods.\\n\\nStarches are the major component of cereals, millets, dals, roots, tubers, and sago. Starches are\\nbland in taste, not readily soluble in cold water but absorb water when soaked in cold water. When\\nstarch granules are added to cold water, a temporary suspension is formed, the starch tends to settle\\nout as soon as the mixture is allowed to stand.\\n\\n\\n\\n236236236236236 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nWhen dry starch is mixed with warm or hot water, the part which comes in contact with water\\nbecomes sticky and the starch granules cling together in lumps. Heating does not help to separate the\\ngranules, because once formed the lumps stay intact. If one of these lumps is broken open, raw starch\\nis found inside.\\n\\nLump formation can be prevented by mixing starch with a little cold water before introducing it\\ninto the hot water; roasting a little before addition of hot water or addition of a little fat, helps to separate\\nthe starch granules and allows them to gelatinise separately. The starches take up water, swell and\\nburst on cooking. When a starch and water mixture is heated, it becomes translucent and forms a\\npaste. This change is accompanied by a change in viscosity. This property is used when starch is used\\nas a thickener in soups, starch puddings and other preparations. A gel is formed at a higher concentration\\nof starch, e.g., puddings. The water is held in a physical bond by the starch. The change in texture,\\ncolour and physical state, which occurs when starch is heated in water, is known as gelatinisation of\\nstarch. In roots and tubers, the presence of starch, which absorbs the water during cooking, results in\\nretention of size.\\n\\nSugars: About 5–11 per cent are present in ripe fruits, malted beverages and in milk. Sucrose the\\nsugar we use in food preparations is one of the pure, manufactured (extracted) foods we use daily. It\\nis manufactured from sugarcane or sugarbeet. Sugar is sweet and is usually used in foods for its\\nsweetening power.\\n\\nSugar dissolves in water and when heated this solution easily forms a syrup. When the solution is\\nsupersaturated and cooked, crystallisation occurs. This is the process used to prepare sweets such as\\nladdus, candies, etc.\\n\\nWhen a high concentration of sugar is used it acts as a preservative by binding moisture, e.g.,\\npreserves such as murrabbas, jams and jellies. In the presence of acids, the sugar (sucrose) is partially\\nhydrolysed to form glucose and fructose, which is known as invert sugar, which is more soluble than\\nsucrose. If sugar is heated beyond its melting point it caramelises or browns. the caramel formed has\\na bitter, astringent flavour. Sugars are readily fermented by microorganisms, thus causing spoilage of\\nfood products containing it.\\n\\nPectins and gums are responsible for holding the plant cells together. These are found in fruits\\nand vegetables in a very small amount. Pectins and gums form colloidal solution when extracted in hot\\nwater and contribute to the viscosity of the product to which they are added. Therefore, these are used\\nas thickeners and stabilisers in food preparation and processing. Pectins form gels in the presence of an\\nappropriate amount of sugar and acid, e.g., fruit jellies.\\n\\nCelluloses and hemicelluloses, the fibrous parts of vegetables and fruits are not soluble in cold or\\nhot water. These soften as the water trapped in their tissues is released and used in cooking or processing.\\nThus there is a decrease in volume, especially of leafy vegetables. Celluloses are not digested by man\\neven after cooking but as it has the capacity to bind moisture, it is helpful in smooth movement of the\\nfood through the digestive tract.\\n\\nProteins\\n\\nEgg, fish, poultry and meat are good examples of protein foods. In dals and legumes the presence\\nof a large amount of starch (50-60 per cent) masks the reactions of proteins during preparation.\\n\\nAll proteins are first denatured and then coagulated by heat. The coagulation occurs between 65\\nand 90°C. The temperature of coagulation increases with the addition of other ingredients. For example,\\negg proteins coagulate at 65–70°C, but egg custard coagulates at 85–90°C. Cooking results in softening\\n\\n\\n\\nEffect of Preparation on Food Components 237237237237237\\n\\nof proteins in foods such as eggs, fish, poultry, meat, as water is bound in the process of coagulation.\\nIf the coagulated protein is further heated, it loses moisture and becomes dry and rubbery. Therefore,\\nit is important to monitor the temperature and time while preparing these foods. Proteins are precipitated\\nby change of pH, e.g., addition of lemon juice to milk to prepare paneer. Proteins bind water, if the\\ncoagulation is gradual, e.g., addition  of lactic inoculum results in the formation of solid curd from\\nliquid milk.\\n\\nOils and Fats\\n\\nMilk, eggs, meat, oilseeds are foods, which contain fat. When foods containing fat are heated, the\\nfat has a tendency to separate from the food. For example, heating milk results in the fat layer floating\\non top, while in cooking meat fat is released as drippings. When milk is curdled to prepare curd, the\\ncream layer is always on top of the curd.\\n\\nOilseeds are extracted to obtain pure oil, butter is clarified in the manufacture of ghee (butter fat).\\nOils and fats are used as a cooking medium. Since these have a higher boiling point than water, the food\\nis cooked quicker in fat. Some fat is absorbed during frying, the amount absorbed depends on  a\\nnumber of factors such as the composition and consistency of the food being fried, the temperature\\nused and the nature of the fat used for frying. Fried foods have a higher energy value as compared to\\nthe same foods prepared by other methods such as boiling or baking. Fats which are solid (congeal) at\\nroom temperature, soften on heating, but do not have a sharp melting-point. When heated beyond its\\nboiling-point, a fat smokes (smoke point), then flashes (flash point) and lastly it catches fire (fire\\npoint). If the fat is heated for a long time, it browns and thickens. These changes are accompanied by\\nchanges in flavour, which may not be acceptable. Therefore effort should be made to minimise these in\\nfood preparation.\\n\\nFats and oils are used to prepare food emulsions with water and air. Stabilisers such as proteins,\\ngums, starches, finely ground spices, in small amounts are used to stabilise these emulsions.\\n\\nFat has shortening power, i.e., its presence between (protein and starch) layers makes the product\\ncrunchy (e.g., baked goods); its presence in meats tenderises it.\\n\\nFats and oils become rancid by action of air (oxidised), water (hydrolysis) and enzymes. These\\nchanges must be minimised, so that the foods in which fat is used remain acceptable.\\n\\nMinerals\\n\\nThere is no loss of minerals in the normal cooking procedures. If cooking water is discarded,\\nsome (a small fraction of) water-soluble minerals may be lost.\\n\\nVitamins\\n\\nAs we know thiamin and vitamin C are the two vitamins, which are most affected by cooking.\\nThe losses may occur due to dissolved nutrients being discarded and destruction due to exposure to\\nheat in cooking. The amount lost depends on a number of factors.\\n\\nThiamin is partly lost in solution and is also destroyed by heat. Some thiamin loss occurs when\\nrice and dal are scrubbed and washed repeatedly prior to cooking. Being soluble in water, if the\\ncooking water is discarded some thiamin is lost. The losses of thiamin in normal cooking vary from 10\\nto 25 per cent.\\n\\n\\n\\n238238238238238 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nVitamin C is the most labile vitamin. It is water soluble, is easily oxidised and is also affected by\\nheat. Washing vegetables after cutting, exposing cut vegetables to air for long periods before cooking\\nand/or serving, result in the loss of a part of the vitamin C present. The average cooking or processing\\nlosses range from 30 to 35 per cent. Therefore, cooking procedures that minimise the loss of vitamin\\nC result in conserving all other nutrients.\\n\\nPigments\\n\\nColour of food has much to do with its acceptance and enjoyment. Vegetables and fruits contribute\\na variety of colours to the dietary. The plant pigments chlorophyll (green leafy vegetables), carotenoids\\n(yellow-orange carrots), flavonoids (white potatoes) and anthocyanins (red beetroot) are present singly\\nor incombination in plant foods. These may be affected by the method of preparation. The soluble\\npigments such as anthocyanins may leach in the cooking water and changes may occur due to the\\neffect of heat and pH (acidity). Table 20.1 summarises the properties of plant pigments, understanding\\nthese may help us in retaining the colour of vegetables and fruits. Other colour changes include the\\nchange in meat pigment during cooking.\\n\\nWhen milk is heated slowly it browns a little due to the reaction of sugar, (lactose) with amino\\nacids. This is a change which is accompanied by flavour changes, which are enjoyed when these are\\nvery slight; if excessive, these are not liked. Similarly caramelisation of sugar, slight  browning of\\nstarch in roasting, bring about colour changes, which are liked when these are slight, but not when\\nthese are excessive and give the dark brown colour of burnt food.\\n\\nSome colour changes, which occur during food preparation are undesirable and efforts are made\\nto minimise these. For example, certain fruits and vegetables such as some varieties of apples and\\nbrinjals brown when cut surfaces are exposed to air. Efforts made to avoid exposure of the cut surfaces\\nto air include-brinjals are cut into water, apples are covered with sugar and/or lime juice, fruit salad is\\nserved with custard.\\n\\nTable 20.1: Properties of Plant Pigments\\n\\nS.No. Food Name of Soluble Effect of In presence of\\nsource pigment Colour in prolonged\\n\\nheat acid alkali\\n\\n1.

In addition salt, sugar, acid, herbs and spices are used in food preparation to modify or\\nenhance the natural flavour of foods during preparation.\\n\\nSalt is the most widely used seasoning in food preparation. When used in pickles, it draws out the\\nwater from the fruit or vegetable and binds it in solution. Organic acids used in food preparation are\\nlemon juice (citric acid), vinegar (acetic acid), tamarind extract (tartaric acid), and cocum extract.\\nTomato juice and mango pulp are also used in preparations for the acidity these contribute. Some of\\nthese extracts contribute thickness as well as acidity to the product. Some of the organic acids slow\\ndown bacterial action and therefore are used as preservatives in pickles. Lactic acid produced in milk,\\ncoagulates milk proteins to form curd and cheese. This change is accompanied by a change in flavour\\nand texture.\\n\\nOxidants and antioxidants: When food is exposed to air, oxyge n from the air acts as an oxidant,\\nand changes occur that are mostly undesirable. For example when cut surfaces of vegetables and fruits\\nare exposed to air, vitamin C is partially lost due to oxidation, the surfaces become brown in colour;\\nfats and oils become flat and then rancid. the metals, copper and iron act as catalysts in such oxidations.\\ntherefore, these metals are not suitable for use in food preparation or processing.\\n\\nSome natural substances such as vitamin E, lecithin, some sulphur-containing amino acids act as\\nantioxidants. These inhibit or prevent oxidation of fats and oils and other substances during storage and\\npreparation. For example, vitamin E is found in some oils and prevents rancidity in these.\\n\\nEnzymes are organic catalysts and control a number of reaction in vegetables and fruits. Ripening\\nof fruits as well as over-ripening is controlled by enzymes. When fruits and vegetables are cooked or\\nexposed to heat, e.g., blanching of vegetables before freezing, enzymes are inactivated. Purified enzymes\\nare used to modify texture of foods. For example, papain is used to tenderise meat and rennin is used\\nto coagulate milk protein in cheese making.\\n\\nRetention of Nutritive Value During Preparation\\n\\nIt is important that all efforts should be made to retain the nutritive value of foods, during\\npreparation. Another important objective in food preparation is to make food that is enjoyed by those\\nwho eat it. It is important to ensure that while retaining the nutritive value of the food, palatability is not\\nsacrificed. It’s good to remember that the food can provide nutrients to the body only after it is eaten.\\nFor example, some loss of thiamin (a vitamin of the B-complex) occurs when beans are cooked. But as\\nwe do not relish uncooked beans, we do cook beans and try to take care in the preparation to ensure\\nthat the loss is minimal. Thus we cook beans in just enough water to avoid loss of nutrients in the\\ncooking water. We cook beans for the minimum time required. We can reduce, cooking time by using\\na pressure cooker, if possible. We can prepare the food just before serving, so that reheating before\\nserving, is avoided.\\n\\nSome simple rules for retaining nutritive value and flavour are given below:\\n1. Wash vegetables before cutting.\\n2. Cut vegetables just  before cooking and introduce cut  vegetables into boiling water, if to  be\\n\\ncooked in water.\\n3. Use just enough water for cooking, if the vegetables or other foods are to be served as such.\\n4. Cook foods until just done and serve immediately.\\n\\n\\n\\n240240240240240 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n5. When preparing soups, the slowest cooking ingredient should be added first, followd by\\naddition of other ingredients, which cook in shorter time. For example, meat needs longer\\ntime and hence can be cooked half-way before adding vegetables, which need much less\\ntime. This procedure helps to avoid overcooking of the vegetables.\\n\\n6. Spices and other flavour ingredients should be added in the oil used for seasoning, as the\\nflavour compounds which are soluble in fat, are thus easily dispersed in the preparation with\\nthe oil or fat.\\n\\n7. Vegetables, salads should be prepared just before serving.\\n8. Use of acid foods, such as lime juice, tomatoes, vinegar or yogurt as dressings in  salads\\n\\nprevents loss of vitamin C, because it is stable in acid medium.\\n9. Fruits are best eaten as they have  been customarily eaten in tropics. Bananas are eaten right\\n\\nafter peeling. Oranges are usually sucked after peeling. Grape fruit is usually peeled and\\neaten. Mangoes are sucked to get the juice. In this manner of eating, no loss of vitamin C\\noccurs, as the fruit is not much exposed before eating.\\n\\nEffects of Cooking on the Microbial Quality of Food\\n\\nAs cooking involves heating of foods, many microorganisms are destroyed during cooking. This\\nrenders the food safe for eating. For example, boiling milk results in killing pathogens like tubercle\\nbacilli if these are present; spoilage organisms are also killed by heating milk. Therefore heated milk\\nkeeps longer than unheated milk. Some of the toxins present in the foods are rendered inactive at the\\ncooking temperature. Thus cooking helps to destroy heat-labile toxins.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. Discuss the changes that occur in starch during food preparation.

A large part\\nof our income is utilised to purchase food for the family. Therefore, it is important to understand\\npersonal preferences in  food, for without attention to the sensory aspects of food, there can be no true\\nenjoyment of it. Let us consider the factors which affect our food acceptance.\\n\\nColour in Food\\n\\nColour affects our acceptance of food. It is said we eat with our eyes, because the first impression\\nof foods is formed by its appearance, which includes colour, shape and aroma. The initial attraction or\\nrejection of food depends on its looks.\\nMost of our traditional or rejection of food depends on its looks. Most of our traditional colour concepts\\naffect our reaction to food. For example, we associate orange-yellow colour with ripe mangoes, red\\n\\n\\n\\n242242242242242 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ncolour with ripe tomatoes and green colour with leafy vegetables. A green orange or a light coloured\\ntomato looks unripe or anaemic and does not attract us.\\n\\nThe colour of food is one way to judge its quality. For example, a green colour is associated with\\nunripe fruit such as mango or orange, a brown banana is thought to be spoilt. In food purchase, colour\\nis used as an important criteria of quality. For example, mature ripe alfonso mangoes have orange-\\nyellow colour. Hence, if the colour is not always a true indicator of quality. Some varieties of oranges\\nhave a green colour even when these are mature, while orange coloured fruit may have sections, which\\nare not juicy.\\n\\nIt is observed that fruit preserves and vegetable pickles darken during storage. Such darkening is\\ncaused by oxidative changes. These changes can be minimised by reducing the oxygen in the top of the\\ncontainer by heat before sealing it. The presence of traces of metals such as iron, tin and copper, in\\nfoods also causes darkening and needs to be avoided.\\n\\nColour added to foods: Since colour affects food acceptance, it is added to food products during\\nprocessing to improve its acceptance. Fruit preserves, cheese, butter, icecream, cakes, confections\\nand candies are some of the food products that have such addition of colour. When we buy these\\nproducts, it is important to select appropriate delicate colour, to ensure attractive, acceptable appearance.\\n\\nColouring materials used in foods belong to two groups—natural colouring material and synthetic\\ncoal-tar dyes. After extensive testing, it has been found that only some of the coal-tar dyes can be\\nsafely used in foods; and these have been certified. Some of these are used in carbonated beverages\\nand fruit preserves.\\n\\nSome of the natural colouring matters, which we use in food preparation, are turmeric and\\nsaffron. In addition to these, other natural colouring substances used in food preparations are annato,\\nbetain, caramel, carotene and chlorophyll.\\n\\nTexture in Foods\\n\\nEach food has a particular texture that we associate with it. Thus well-cooked rice is soft, potato\\nwafers are crisp and cucumber slice has a crunchy texture. We learn  about food texture very early in\\nour eating experience.\\n\\nA variety of qualities are included in texture, such as, crisp, soft, hard, sticky, elastic, tough,\\ngummy or stringy. If there is change in the accepted, characteristic texture, we find the food unacceptable.\\nThus we reject tough beans, hard rice, lumpy upma, and fibrous vegetables, because their texture is\\nunlike the texture we associate with these foods. On the other hand, we enjoy crisp toast, soft velvety\\nhalwas, flaky pastry and sticky jalebi. The textural qualities of food depend on the ingredients, their\\nproportion, the manner in which these are combined and the method of preparation.\\n\\nCereals: Texture is developed with meticulous care in cereal preparations such as chapati, bread,\\nand cakes. In preparation of chapati, we knead the dough and set it aside for a few minutes to obtain\\na soft velvet textured chapati. In preparation of bread, the dough is allowed to ferment after mixing\\nwith yeast, punched to ensure even, sponge-like structure. In making cakes, the sugar and fat are\\ncreamed, the flour is sifted to incorporate air, and mixed with the creamed sugar to obtain the desired\\nstructure, when baked.\\n\\nFruits and Vegetables: The texture of fruits and vegetables is determined by the cell wall. The cell\\nwall is composed of polysaccharides. During maturation, ripening and preparation, there are changes\\nin the amount and kinds of polysaccharides, which result in changes in the texture of vegetables and\\n\\n\\n\\nFactors Affecting Food Acceptance 243243243243243\\n\\nfruits. For example, when a fruit ripens, a large part of starch is broken down to sugars, resulting in\\nsoftening of texture and change in flavour of the fruit. When a bean gets mature, the bean toughens and\\ngets lignified, its texture becomes very hard and it needs more time to cook than the immature bean.\\nThere is a change in the taste also. Thus the texture of the food affects the time taken to cook or\\nprocess it. It also affects its acceptability.\\n\\nMeal: As you know the texture of meat depends on the part of the animal from which the cut is\\ntaken, the age of the animal and the method of preparation and the duration. The meat cuts with low\\ncontent of connective tissue, can be cooked by dry methods, such as roasting or shallow frying. But\\nmeat cuts, which have a large amount of connective tissue, are prepared by use of moist methods of\\npreparation, such as pressure-cooking, boiling or stewing, to make these cuts tender.\\n\\nThe texture of meat is very easily determined by the number of times one needs to chew and how\\nhard one has to bite to cut the piece. If it takes long to chew the meat, it is a tough product. It is\\npossible to improve the texture of meat by treating tough meat with chemical tenderisers. These help to\\nbreak down the connective tissue partially and thus improve the texture of the product.\\n\\nFlavour in Food\\n\\nFlavour is the sum-total of the sensory impression formed, when we eat food. It includes the\\naroma, the taste and even the texture, and thus involves all our senses. It is the most important aspect\\nof food, which decides our choices of food. While an appropriate colour and texture may induce us to\\nsample a food, whether we will eat more of it, depends on its flavour. Thus flavour of food is as\\nimportant a quality as its nutritional composition.\\n\\nFood flavour is intimately related to food preparation practices. We like flavour of foods made in\\nour home in our community and region, because these are familiar to us. Thus food flavour acceptance\\nis intimately related to our dietary pattern. If our exposure to food flavours has been limited, it is not\\neasy for us to adapt to new flavours, and we may not enjoy a variety of flavours.\\n\\nOdour: The odour or smell of food influences our food acceptance. The aroma of ripe mango\\nattracts us, while the smell of overripe fruit repels us. The substances, which are responsible for odour\\nof food, are volatile, which means these evaporate and form vapours easily. The odours are carried by\\nthe air to our nose, and are transmitted by special nerves (olfactory nerves) to our brain. You can get\\nthe odour even before you eat the food; you also perceive the odour when you eat the food. The odour\\naffects our acceptance of food, depending on whether it is liked or not. The primary odours are sweet\\nor fragrant, sour or acid, burnt and rancid. You may have noticed that our sense of smell is far more\\nacute than the sense of taste. Therefore anything that affects its function, impairs our enjoyment of\\nfood. For example, if you suffer from a cold, your sense of smell is impaired and you find that the food\\ndoes not taste as good as when you are well. Similarly, the function of sensory organs is impaired with\\nage, which results in decreased enjoyment of food by the aged persons.\\n\\nTouch: The sense of touch contributes to our perception of food. It identifies the textural qualities\\nof the food, such as softness and hardness. Similarly, we perceive the crisp, the crunchy or sticky\\ntexture by touching the food. When the touch conforms to the textural profile of the food in our\\nmemory, it enhances the anticipation and enjoyment of food. If it does not create a favourable image,\\nwe hesitate to taste the food. For example, a slimy touch indicates spoilage, be it a carrot or a bread\\nslice.\\n\\nTaste: Taste sensations are the sum-total of the sensations created by food when it is put in the\\nmouth. The sensation of taste is perceived when the taste receptors (taste buds) are stimulated. The\\n\\n\\n\\n244244244244244 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ntaste buds are located on the surface of the tongue. The food must be dissloved in liquid to enable us to\\nperceive its taste. Hence we have to masticate dry foods such as roasted groundnuts mix these with\\nsaliva, so that we can taste these. We can perceive the taste of liquids, such as tea, sherbet or lassi,\\nimmediately, as these can stimulate the taste  buds as soon as we drink these.\\n\\nThere are four primary taste sensations—sweet, sour, salty and bitter. The taste of the food is\\ndetermined by its chemical composition. Sugars present in foods or added to foods are responsible for\\nsweet taste, while salty taste is due to salts present in foods or added to food. Sour or acid taste is\\ncontributed mainly by organic acids found in foods (such as citric acid in limes), added to foods (such\\nas tamarind extract added to dal) or developed in food (lactic acid formed when milk is made into\\ncurd).\\n\\nCertain foods such as coffee beans and fenugreek have bitter taste, while breakdown of proteins\\nproduces substances, with bitter taste. The taste of most foods is a blend of these primary tastes.\\n\\nThe primary tastes can be modified by combination of the compounds responsible for these. For\\nexample, the sourness of lime can be reduced by addition of sugar; the bitterness of fenugreek is\\nreduced by adding coconut and jaggery. Thus you find that a variety of steps can be taken to modify\\nthe flavour of natural foods. We can use flavouring substances, naturally present in foods or those\\nsynthesised in the factory, during food preparation and processing to improve acceptability and add\\nvariety to our diet.\\n\\nFlavouring Substances\\n\\nA variety of materials are used in food preparation and processing to enhance, blend and alter the\\nnatural flavours. Appropriate use of these can make a insipid dish into a highly palatable product. There\\nis ample scope for creativity in use of flavouring substances in food preparation. A large variety of\\nflavouring substances are used in Indian homes. These include salt, a variety of acidic substances,\\nherbs and spices, and extracts of herbs and spices.\\n\\nSalt: Salt is the most widely used condiment. It is one of the few pure chemicals used in food\\npreparation. It is obtained by evaporation of sea water. It is used to season all food preparations except\\nsweets. It is used in food preservation to make pickles, chutneys and sauces. Salt has the unique\\nproperty of enhancing the flavour of herbs and spices in food preparations.\\n\\nAcids: Lemon juice, tamarind, cocum, amchur and vinegar are the acid substances very commonly\\nused in Indian homes. Lemon juice is used in salads and savoury preparations such as upma, batatepohe,\\nbhel, etc. Tamarind is soaked and the acid extract thus obtained is used in sambar, rasam, puliyore\\n(tamarind rice), and many other vegetable preparations in the southern parts of India. In western India,\\nwhere ratambi (the fruit from which cocum is made) is available, cocum is used in food preparation.\\nVinegar is dilute acetic acid. It is used to flavour salads, pickles, and sauces. Amchur, made from raw\\nmangoes, is also used in some preparations to impart acidic taste.\\n\\nHerbs and Spices: India is known as the ‘Home of Spices’. Spices and herbs form an indispensable\\npart of our cultural food pattern. These impart a subtle flavour to foods. Their presence is evident by\\ntheir irresistible aroma, which whets our appetite. They add zest to otherwise insipid foods. Hence\\nthese are the most important group of flavouring materials in the Indian cuisine.\\n\\nSpices and herbs come from various parts of plants, such as the fruits, seeds, berries, roots,\\nrhizomes, leaves, the bark, the floral parts, kernel, aril and exudate of bark. The flavour is due to small\\namounts of essential oils and organic acids present in the specific part of the plant. Each one of these\\n\\n\\n\\nFactors Affecting Food Acceptance 245245245245245\\n\\nhas a characteristic component, which is responsible for its individual flavour. These are available as\\nwhole dried spices and as ground powders also. One problem associated with spices is adulteration. As\\nthese are expensive products, ground hulls, sawdust, and other waste materials are added to increase\\nthe bulk and thus increase profit margin. Microscopic and chemical tests can help to identify the\\nadulterants.\\n\\nFlavouring Extracts: Flavouring extracts are obtained from spices by extraction with alcohol,\\nsteam distillation or by expression in a press. These are normally solutions of the essential oils in\\nalcohol. These are best stored in a cool place in tightly stoppered containers. As these are concentrated\\nsolutions of the flavour, very minute amount is needed to be added to impart the desired flavour. Some\\nof the flavouring extracts available include ginger, cardamom, saffron, vanilla, orange, cinnamon, etc.\\n\\nMany synthetic chemical compounds are now available in the market, which have a flavour\\nsimilar to that of the natural extract. These are used extensively, because these are much cheaper than\\nthe natural flavouring extracts.\\n\\nUse of Spices and Flavourings: These are added to the food normally towards the end of preparation.\\nThere is no set proportion, which is acceptable to all, as individual variation in the tolerance to these is\\nvery great.\\n\\nSpices may be used in the whole or powdered form. Whole spices are usually added to hot oil as\\na seasoning, before being dispersed in the food preparation. Oil acts as a solvent for the flavour\\ncomponents present in the spices. Ground spices may be added to the food directly, e.g., pepper, jeera\\npowder, spice mix, etc.\\n\\nHerbs are normally cut and simmered in hot fat or oil to extract the, characteristic flavour before\\nbeing added to the preparation. As prolonged cooking will cause loss of volatile components, it is\\nadvisable to add flavouring material towards the end of preparation. As you may know, these materials\\nare very light and very small amount is needed to impart the flavour. For example, a teaspoonful sambar\\npodi weighs only two grammes, and it is sufficient to flavour about 600 milliliters of sambar. Thus it\\namounts to only 1 part in 300, but its contribution to improving the palatability of the product is truly\\nremarkable. In the use of flavouring materials it is good to remember that while a small addition is good,\\nmore of it may result in decreased acceptability of the food product. So you must practice moderation\\nin use of these materials.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. Discuss the texture of food with reference to cereals, fruit and meat.\\n2. What are the primary odours?

Food sanitation is an essential aspect of food preparation. It needs to be emphasised at\\nevery stage of food handling and preparation. Some of the items which need particular attention are:\\n\\n(i) a safe and potable water supply,\\n(ii) selection of wholesome ingredients and\\n\\n(iii) hygienic handling, during preparation and serving.\\nThese steps prevent entry of spoilage and pathogenic organisms in the food.\\n\\nIn addition, all the equipment coming in contact with food should be scrupulously clean; the\\nsurroundings should be clean and there should be a proper and safe method for the disposal of waste.\\nInculcation of hygienic habits would help in preventing foods from being contaminated during handling.\\n\\nWater\\n\\nWater is essential in food preparation. It is used to wash food before cooking, it is used to act as\\na cooking medium, it is used to clean the containers of food before and after preparation and it is used\\nalso as the most important beverage. Therefore, it is essential that all water meant for drinking and\\ncooking purposes should be free from pathogenic bacteria. Water used for making ice must also be\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Sanitation and Hygiene 247247247247247\\n\\npotable. The ice may be used to cool foods or added to cold drinks. Thus it is important to ensure that\\nthe ice we sometimes buy be made from potable water. Some of the diseases, which can be spread by\\nthe use of contaminated water are cholera, typhoid, paratyphoid, bacillary dysentery and amoebic\\ndysentery.\\n\\nPotable Water\\n\\nWater, which is free from pathogenic bacteria and is palatable, is known as potable water. The\\nnecessity of a potable water supply in the home and place of work can never be overemphasised. It is\\nalso important in institutions preparing, processing and serving food.\\n\\nFigure 22.1:  When water is scarce, sanitation suffers.\\n(a) Water sources far from home (b) Water—limited availability\\n\\nApart from the primary precaution to ensure that water  be free from harmful bacteria, it is also\\nnecessary to make it palatable. For example, water may contain dissolved salts or minerals, which may\\ngive it a brackish taste. For specific uses such as chemical analyses water may have to be given special\\ntreatment with resins to remove dissolved impurities or salts. We will concern ourselves mainly with\\nthe treatment of water to render it safe for potable purposes.\\n\\nIn India, even though the necessity of using ‘pure water’ has been known for centuries1, there\\nwas no safe and protected water supply up to 1949 for as much as 81 per cent of the population who\\nstay mostly in the villages.\\n\\n(a) Water source far from\\nhome\\n\\nWater runs bet. 6-7 a.m. Queue for\\nwater\\n\\n(b) Water-limited availability\\n\\n5 km WellHome\\n\\n1. In some of the Sanskrit texts written around the year 2000 B.C., it has been stated that ‘it is good to keep\\nwater in a copper vessel, to expose it to sunlight and to filter it in charcoal’. Similarly, another text says,\\n‘Water should be purified by boiling over fire, by heating in the sun, or by dropping a heated iron in it and\\nthen allowing it to cool; or it may be purified by filtering through coarse sand gravel.’\\n\\n\\n\\n248248248248248 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThe National Water Supply and Sanitation Programme was launched in 1954 as a part of the\\nHealth Plan to assist the States in their urban and rural water supply and sanitation schemes so as to\\nprovide adequate water supply and sanitation facilities in the whole country. By 1979, 2,108 towns had\\nbeen provided with water benefiting an urban population of one hundred million people. 217 towns\\nwith a population of forty million people (about 36 per cent of the urban population) had been covered\\nby partial sewerage system. Of the 5,76,000 villages it is estimated that more than two lakh problem\\nvillages remained to be covered with potable water supply as on April 1,1980. Efforts are being made\\nto meet the water and sanitation needs of the entire country.2\\n\\nEven today the average Indian, educated or uneducated, a villager or a city-dweller, is very\\nparticular about seeing that the vessels used for storage of water is not contaminated in the home. So\\nit is not the use in the home but the source of the water supply which may be suspect.\\n\\nSources of Contamination of Water\\n\\nThe usual source of contamination of water is through the seepage of sewage.\\nSewage can be a carrier of many pathogenic bacteria because many healthy persons may be\\n\\n‘carriers’ of pathogenic bacteria without being affected themselves. Persons who are suffering from\\nenteric diseases will also contribute to the presence of bacteria in sewage. The disposal of sewage is\\nnot paid much attention to, especially in the rural communities, where human excreta is deposited near\\nshallow wells, ponds or even rivers; contamination from this source is widespread.\\n\\nIn cities, the huge influx of population, which results in rapid formation of hutment dwellings\\nwithout proper sanitary and water facilities, develop into a health hazard. Sufficient water is not available\\nusually at such dwellings and the use of water from any source is resorted to, sometimes even gutter\\nwater being used. It is not that the hutment dwellers are not aware of the hazards involved, but they\\nhave no other alternative.\\n\\nThere is no facility for drainage and the used water and sewage stand, encouraging breeding of\\nmosquitoes and flies. These pests carry and spread pathogens from sewage to nearby localities, thus\\ncreating health problems. Exposed ready-to-eat foods sold in such localities may be contaminated by\\nthe flies.\\n\\nAnother difficulty experienced in cities with protected water supplies is the difficulty of maintaining\\na positive pressure in all pipelines. In cities many of the pipelines have become very old and unless there\\nis a continuous flow of water into them with a positive pressure there is a possibility of seepage of\\nbacteria, from sewage into water pipes. With limited supply of water available, in many Indian cities, all\\nthe pipes can never be holding water all the 24 hours. This is a problem, which does cause concern.\\n\\nThe effluents from many industries, which are at present mostly discharged into rivers are another\\nsource of contamination; this problem is assuming serious proportions. Many of these effluents use up\\nmuch of the oxygen from the water with the result that fish and other aquatic animals are unable to\\nsurvive.\\n\\nFoul smell emanates from such streams, due to anaerobic decomposition (putrefaction) of dead\\nfish, thus making the water unfit for human consumption.\\n\\nTreatment of Water\\n\\nIt is thus essential that water used for potable purposes be free from pathogenic bacteria. The\\nbest precaution one can take is to prevent the source of water from contamination  with sewage.\\n\\n2. Source: India, Reference Manual; Ministry of Information, 1981.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Sanitation and Hygiene 249249249249249\\n\\nIn villages this can be done by constructing cement sides to deep wells to prevent bacteria from\\nseeping through the soil and gaining entrance in the water. Well water which may be contaminated can\\nbe purified by the addition of bleaching powder. A simple and inexpensive gadget using this principle\\nhas been fabricated by the Central Public Health Engineering Research Institute. Bleaching powder on\\nreaction with water releases chlorine which is capable of killing pathogenic organisms. In villages\\nwhere there is no treated water, drinking water should preferably be boiled and then cooled. This would\\ndestory all the pathogenic bacteria. Water used for cooking need not be boiled, as it would be boiled\\nanyway during cooking. Water used for washing, cleaning need not be boiled as long as it is not foul\\nsmelling and does not contain any suspended impurities.\\n\\nFigure 22.2: Water filter.\\n\\nIn cities and towns where it is necessary to supply a large population with water, effective\\nmethods have to be used for the purification of water. The source of water is usually a lake in which\\nthe water is allowed to stand. This results in most of the suspended impurities settling down. Further\\nthe action of sunlight and the paucity of food results in the destruction of bacteria. In the next stage,\\nwhich may consist of a filtration through sand most of the bacteria are eliminated. As an added precaution,\\nwater supplies to cities are chlorinated. This may either be done by the addition of bleaching powder, or\\nas is done in most of the cities, by the injection of liquid chlorine. To make sure that the bacteria which\\nmay have entered into the pipelines through seepage when there is no positive pressure, additional\\nchlorination is resorted to at different locations during the transportation of water from the lake to city\\nreservoirs. This is understandable when it is realised that the source of water may be 60 to 70 km away\\nfrom the city. Water may be rendered potable by use of water filter in the home (Figure 22.2).\\n\\nWhat you can do about pesticide residue\\n\\nPesticide residue can pose a serious problem in the diet. There are certain precautions which you\\ncan take to reduce dietary exposure to this hazard. These are:\\n\\n\\n\\n250250250250250 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n1. Thoroughly rinse and scrub fruits and vegetables. Peel them if appropriate.\\n2. Remove outer leaves of leafy vegetables, such as cabbage and lettuce.\\n3. Trim fat from meat, poultry and fish; discard oils and fats in broths and drippings.\\n4. Throw back the big fish—the little ones have less time to take up and concentrate pesticides\\n\\nand other harmful residues.\\n\\nFood\\n\\nAll vegetables and fruits either from bazar or grown in one’s own farm would have to be cleaned,\\nand prepared for either eating directly or cooking. The dirt or dust which we find on foods as we buy\\nthem can be carrier of spores of microorganisms. Therefore, all exposed food must be washed with\\nclean water before use. Outer layers, skins of plant material contain thousands of microorganisms and\\nmust be washed thoroughly before use. If any parts of fruits and vegetables are bruised these should be\\ntrimmed to reduce contamination.\\n\\nThe skin, hair, feathers, intestines of animals harbour a number of microorganisms. It is, therefore,\\nnecessary to remove these, before animal products are prepared for human consumption.\\n\\nFood Handling\\n\\nFood comes into contact with human hands during harvesting, storage, preparation and service.\\nIt is important that food handlers be free from any communicable diseases—colds, any other respiratory\\nailment, cuts or boils, as they may be responsible for transferring these to the food thereby spreading\\nthe infection to persons consuming the food.\\n\\nHuman hair, nasal discharge, skin can also be source of microorganisms. Therefore, persons\\nhandling food, must wash hands with soap before starting preparation, and refrain from touching hair\\nor wiping nose during food preparation.\\n\\nFood sanitation is a way of life. It can never be overemphasised. A number of gastrointestinal\\ndisorders, such as diarrhoea, cholera and communicable diseases such as typhoid, septic sore throat,\\ndiphtheria, dysentery, etc., are communicated by use of contaminated water or food (Figure 22.3).\\nTherefore, it is very important that sanitary handling of food and water is religiously adhered to (Figure\\n22.4).\\n\\nFigure 22.3: Spread of diseases through faecal contamination.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Sanitation and Hygiene 251251251251251\\n\\nFigure 22.4: Sanitary handling of food.\\n\\nFood Contamination\\nFood may be contaminated if the:\\n1. Water used for washing or cleaning is not potable.\\n2. Soil adhering to foods grown close to ground is not completely removed.\\n3. Containers or utensils used for storage and preparation are not clean.\\n4. Personnel handling food have unhygienic habits.\\n5. Personnel handling food suffer from communicable diseases.\\n\\nEquipment\\n\\nIt is necessary that all equipment coming in contact with food be kept clean. This includes knives,\\nmeat mincers, blenders, rolling pins, wooden boards, metal and porcelain dishes, utensils, etc. They\\nshould be scrubbed, cleaned with detergent and water and then rinsed with potable water. It is a good\\npractice to see that such equipment are dipped in hot water at 80°C for at least 30 seconds or more and\\nthen allowed to drain dry. This sanitary step is especially important during epidemics such as infective\\nhepatitis (infective jaundice), cholera, etc. Parts of blenders, mixers, etc., should be inspected after\\ncleaning to ensure that there is no food material left over. If allowed to remain they could allow harmful\\nmicroorganisms to grow and spoil the food. Equipment made of plastic and other such material which\\ncannot withstand high temperatures need not be given the dip in hot water but should be given other\\ntreatments and then allowed to drain dry.\\n\\nIn villages it is a common practice to scrub utensils and dishes with ash and then rinse them with\\nwater. The utensils and dishes are then allowed to dry in the sun. The alkaline ash acts as a good agent\\n\\n\\n\\n252252252252252 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nfor killing any microorganisms adhering to the utensils and a sanitary effect is produced by drying in\\nthe sun both because of heat and the ultraviolet rays.\\n\\nControl of Insects and Rodents\\n\\nOne of the common insects contaminating foods is the housefly. These have minute hair on their\\nlegs and thus can be the carriers of harmful bacteria depending on where they come from. It is possible\\nthat they may carry faecal matter or other such sources of pathogenic bacteria and deposit it on the\\nfood.\\n\\nAnother insect which can also be a source of contamination in the same way as the housefly is\\nthe cockroach. These insects, which usually prefer darkness, have been known to cause diarrhoea and\\ndysentery.\\n\\nApart from these two common ones, there are innumerable insects ranging from the larvae found\\nin wheat and rice to locusts, which can cause serious damage to food.\\n\\nRodents, which include rats, mice and bandicoots, not only consume large quantities of food,\\nthus contributing to the overall shortage of food in the country, but may also be the carriers of diseases\\nsuch as plague.\\n\\nThe presence of insects, insect fragments, rodent excreta and other matter of insect and rodent\\norigin (even though it may not necessarily be dangerous to health) is aesthetically resented by consumers.\\nHealth authorities condemn such food as unfit for consumption because it indicates poor practices of\\nsanitation where the food was prepared.\\n\\nIt is thus essential that preventive measures be taken to exclude the entry of insects and rodents\\nin the house, especially in the cooking and serving areas. This can be done by:\\n\\n(i) Keeping the prepared food in cupboards with wire-netting.\\n(ii) Filling cracks, fissures in the walls and flooring which are usually the places where insects\\n\\nbreed and multiply.\\n(iii) Covering drains, holes, etc., with wire gauze so as to prevent the entry of rodents.\\nPrecautions such as these if taken in villages and small towns where people normally stay in\\n\\nindependent homes would certainly prevent the entry of insects and rodents. In large cities, however,\\nwhere each building may have many apartments, unless measures are taken by the whole community,\\nthere is always a danger of insects and rodents travelling from one apartment to another.\\n\\nThe control of insects and rodents can be carried out in several ways of which the most common\\none practised in the home is spraying or dusting with an insecticide. Fumigation may be resolved to in\\nlarge godowns, factories, etc., as it destroys insects and rodents.\\n\\nSprays or dustings make use of chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as DDT, TDE, aldrin, dieldrin,\\netc.) and the organic phosphorus compounds (such as Parathion, Malathion, Systrex, etc.) as the\\nactive ingredient for killing the insect. Baits in which chemicals may be mixed with food are also\\nsuccessful in getting rid of pests. Examples of these are “Tygon” in which a chemical is mixed with\\nsugar and a home-made mixture of boric powder and bengalgram dal flour, which when ingested by\\ncockroaches results in their death. Warfrain may be mixed with food and used as a bait for the elimination\\nof rodents.\\n\\nIt must be noted that insecticides are poisonous, and must be used in very small amounts only\\nwhere needed. If used indiscriminately these are likely to enter our bodies and harm us after a period of\\ntime. It is important to store these out of reach of children and away from food, to prevent accidents.\\n\\n\\n\\nFood Sanitation and Hygiene 253253253253253\\n\\nPractical Rules for Good Sanitation\\n\\n1.

The modifications are based on the changed\\nneeds of the individual, due to age or sickness. Figure 23.1 depicts changes in consistency of diet to\\nsuit varying needs.\\n\\nNormal Diet forms the basis of all modifications of diets for age and sickness; but due attention\\nmust be paid to nutritional needs of the individual. Normal diet is planned according to the recommended\\ndaily dietary intakes, which are designed to meet the needs of all healthy persons and may not meet the\\nneeds of sick persons. The nutritional requirements depend on the activity, the increased or decreased\\ndemands for certain nutrients, which need to be considered in planning the diet.\\n\\nFigure 23.1: Changes in consistency of diet.\\n\\nAdaptation of Normal Diet for Changing\\n\\nNeeds\\n\\n\\n\\n258258258258258 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThe plan given in Table 23.1 for a normal diet may be adapted to suit different cultural or socio-\\neconomic circumstances.\\n\\nModifications of Normal Diet: The normal diet may be modified to:\\n1. Provide change in consistency, e.g., soft and fluid diets;\\n2. Provide foods bland in flavour;\\n3. Modify intervals of feeding;\\n4. Increase or decrease energy content;\\n5. Increase or decrease other nutrients, e.g., protein;\\n6. Increase or decrease fibre.\\n\\nLiquid and Soft Diets\\n\\nThe type of modification relates to the condition and need of the individual concerned. The\\nselection of foods is made on the same principles as the normal diet, using the daily food guide.\\n\\nMechanical Soft Diet: Many people, including infants, need soft diet because they have no\\nteeth. Therefore, the only change made is in the consistency of the foods served. No restriction is\\nplaced on food selection. This diet is sometimes described as mechanically soft diet.\\n\\nTable 23.1: Normal Diet\\n\\nFood Group Foods to be Included Amount\\n\\n1 Rice\\nChapati/Roti\\nUpma/Shira/Pohe 6 or more servings\\nBread. etc.\\n\\n2.

Chutney may be acceptable.\\n\\n• Raw fruits, which are juicy and soft can be included—banana, mango (non-fibrous varieties),\\noranges, musambi, grape fruit, soft berries, jack fruit (soft variety), all melons, grapes, with\\nsoft skins, soft pear, peaches, apricots, plums (minus skins), etc.\\n\\n• Apples may be served after cooking or baking.\\n• Tough skins, stones, fibres should be removed from fruits and vegetables, e.g., apple skin,\\n\\npotato skin, etc.\\n• Nuts and dried fruits need to be finely ground, when used.\\n\\nSoft Diet: It is a step between the full liquid and the normal diet. It is served to persons suffering\\nfrom acute infections, gastrointestinal disturbances or persons recovering from surgery. The diet consists\\nof simple soft foods, which are easy to chew and easy to digest. Harsh fibre, fatty or highly spiced\\nfoods are avoided. It is nutritionally adequate, when planned according to the Daily Food Guide. The\\nsoft diet includes:\\n\\n• Soft cooked rice, soft chapati and bread—6 servings or more\\n• Milk, dahi (curd), buttermilk, paneer, soft cheese—2-3 servings\\n• Dals, well-cooked—2-3 servings\\n• Eggs poached, boiled, trader ground meat, fish and poultry—2-3 servings\\n• Vegetables and fruits made up of\\n\\n1.

The adequacy of\\nsuch a diet will depend on the types of liquids permitted.\\n\\nFull fluid diet is served to persons, who are very ill and cannot chew or swallow solid food. It\\nincludes all foods, which are liquid at 37°C. To avoid difficulty in swallowing, fibrous foods and\\nirritating spices are not included in this diet. The period of use of this diet depends on the condition of\\n\\n\\n\\n260260260260260 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nthe patient. As the nutrient content is diluted, the interval between feeds is reduced and the number of\\nfeeds is increased to six or more.\\n\\nThe protein content of the diet can be increased by adding skimmed milk powder in the soups and\\nbeverages. Cooked, mashed dal can be used to prepare soups. Strained, ground meat or fish can be\\nadded to broths.\\n\\nThe energy content of the diet can be increased by adding (a) cream to milk, (b) butter/oil to\\ncereal gruels and dal soups, (c) glucose to juices, milk, (d) using cream in desserts.\\n\\nThe following foods can be included in the full fluid diet:\\n• Milk—1 litre\\n• Eggs—2 (in custard or in eggnog )\\n• Dal, well-cooked—25–50 g\\n• Meat/fish cooked and strained—25-50 g\\n• Cereal strained—1/2 cup (100 g) cooked as gruel\\n• Vegetables—1/4 cup cooked, strained or puree for soup\\n• Fruit juices—1 cup, citrus and other strained juices\\n• Tomato or vegetable juices—1/2 cup\\n• Butter\\n• Sugar\\n• Kheer, icecream, gelatin dessert, custard\\n• Soups—broth\\n• Tea, coffee, soft drinks\\n• Flavourings, salt.\\n\\nClear fluid diet is given when a person is unable to tolerate food, due to nausea, vomiting, gas-\\nformation, diarrhoea, or extreme lack of appetite. This diet is given for a day or two, until the patient is\\nable to take a more liberal liquid diet.\\n\\nAs the name indicates the diet consists of clear liquids such as tea with lemon and sugar, coffee,\\ncereal extracts (extract of puffed cereals also), strained fruit juices, carbonated beverages, dal extract,\\nfat-free broth, etc. The amount is restricted to 30 to 60 ml per hour in the beginning and gradually\\nincreased. This diet replaces the fluids lost by the body, thus preventing dehydration.\\n\\nRecent trend is to help the patient to progress from clear liquid to liquid to soft to mechanically\\nsoft to normal diet as quickly as possible. Therefore, the inadequacy of the first stage of diet may not\\naffect the patient’s health adversely, as he is encouraged to get through this stage in a day or two.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

In most illnesses,\\n\\nthe patient’s diet complements the medical or surgical treatment. The rate of recovery thus is determined\\nby the patient’s acceptance and intake of the diet prescribed. In certain ailments such as obesity and\\ndiabetes mellitus modified diet is the most important input to help the patient’s recovery.\\n\\n\\n\\n262 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nAll therapeutic diets are modifications of the normal diet made in order to meet the altered needs\\nresulting from disease. As you may have noted in Chapter 14, the normal diet is planned to meet the\\nrecommended dietary allowances (RDA), using the basic five food groups.\\n\\nTherapeutic diet is planned to meet or exceed the dietary allowances of a normal person as the\\naim of diet therapy is to maintain health and help the patient to regain nutritional wellbeing.\\n\\nIn certain ailments it may be necessary to restrict intake of calories (as in weight reduction diets)\\nor sodium (as in heart ailment).\\n\\nFood Acceptance in Illness\\n\\nIllness leads to poor food acceptance due to:\\n(i) Reduced desire or interest in food due to lack of appetite, gastrointestinal disturbances or\\n\\ndiscomfort after eating.\\n(ii) Reduced appetite due to inactivity.\\n\\n(iii) Reduced appetite due to some drugs.\\nIn addition a patient in hospital faces a number of stressors. These include:\\n(i) Altered time of eating and rest as compared to home.\\n\\n(ii) A lot of questions are asked; some of these are very personal.\\n(iii) Movements to various laboratories for investigations or tests.\\n(iv) A lot of waiting for tests to be done.\\n(v) Fear of tests and their results.\\n\\n(vi) Hospital staff, who monitor the patient, may intrude on privacy.\\n(vii) Other patients in the ward or room may cause anxiety.\\n\\nTo counteract these stressors, a relative, a nurse or a case manager is needed to monitor the\\npatient’s care.\\n\\nIn this stressful situation, the only comfort for the patient may be food.\\n\\nIllness Affects Nutrition\\n\\nThe nutrient needs and their use in the body may be affected by illness. The patient does not have\\nappetite, may have pain and/or vomiting. This may result in insufficient food intake. Nutrient absorption\\nmay be poor due to severe diarrhoea, which may lead to loss of weight, malnutrition and even dehydration.\\n\\nThe patient may face problems such as poor appetite, too much or too little food served etc.\\nTherapeutic diets may be bland, less salty, poor in texture and choice. Food acceptance of modified\\ndiets can be a problem. These problems need to be anticipated and resolved by discussion with the\\npatient.\\n\\nThe patient may feel relief if the appetite is satisfied, meals are attractive, colourful and include\\nsome well-prepared favourite foods.\\n\\nIn fever, the metabolic rate is increased and so the need for all nutrients (calories, proteins,\\nvitamins) is increased. Nutrient utilization is adversely affected in metabolic diseases.\\n\\nThe patient’s lack of movement (due to confinement to bed or wheelchair) for many days increases\\nloss of nitrogen and calcium from the body. These are some of the problems that need attention and\\nsolution.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinciples of Diet Therapy and Therapeutic Nutrition 263\\n\\nNutritional Assessment in the Clinical Setting\\nNutritional assessment is used to decide the nutritional status of the patient. Nutritional assessment\\n\\nincludes anthropometric, clinical, dietary and laboratory measurements.\\nAnthropometric measurements include height, weight, BMI (body mass index), triceps skinfold\\n\\nand sometimes other skinfolds.\\nBody Mass Index (BMI), a value calculated from height-weight data, is an indicator of the body\\n\\nfat content. Standards of BMI have been developed for use in judging the health status of the person.\\n(Table 24.1)\\n\\nBMI = Wt. in kg / Ht. in metre2\\n\\nTable 24.1 BMI in Adults (Men and Women)\\n\\n  Adults BMI\\n\\nNormal 19-24\\n\\nObesity – Grade I 25-29\\n\\nObesity – Grade II 30-40\\n\\nObesity – Grade III > 40\\n\\nSkinfold measurements help to assess the energy reserves in the form of fat. An average of three\\nof these values are used to compare with a set of normal values.\\n\\nMidarm Circumference (MC) gives an indication of body protein reserves and helps to detect\\nprotein malnutrition.\\n\\nClinical Assessment includes examination of eyes, teeth, gums, tongue, skin and hair to observe\\nsymptoms of nutritional deficiency. It is quick, but subjective and not specific.\\n\\nDietary Assessment is an essential basis for dietary counselling. There are several methods\\nused, which include 24 hour recall, food frequency list, a food diary, diet history and observations at\\nmeal times. These help in evaluation of the food intake to detect possible deficiencies.\\n\\nLaboratory Assessment involves whole blood, blood serum and blood plasma analysis; sometimes\\nurine analysis is done to determine the level or the excretion rate of the nutrients or their metabolites.\\n\\nDietary Counselling is intended to produce a desirable change in the food behaviour. Preventive\\nhealth care, especially dietary care, can reduce the risks of patients developing chronic diseases. Its\\nsuccess depends on the trust and active involvement of the patient.\\n\\nIt has been observed that malnourished patients take longer to recover. Hence nutritional assessment\\nshould be a routine part of all patients’ care.\\n\\nAll patients do not need in-depth assessment. A simple method of clinical observation helps to\\ndetect those at-risk  of malnutrition. Only patients at risk need to undergo comprehensive nutritional\\nassessment.\\n\\nNutrition history and clinical evaluation can help to identify individuals who are at risk nutritionally\\n(Table 24.2).\\n\\nWhen the nature, extent and cause of the problems are determined, on the basis of clinical\\nobservations, a plan of nutritional care can be made.\\n\\n\\n\\n264 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nTable 24.2 Clinical Observations Suggesting Malnutrition\\n\\n1. Recent loss of 10% or more of usual body weight.\\n\\n2. Restricted oral intake of nutrients for 10 days or more (e.g. clear liquid diet or IV\\ninfusions of simple solutions only)\\n\\n3. Protracted nutrient losses as a result of\\n(a) Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, malabsorption syndromes\\n(b) Surgical removal of portions of gastrointestinal tract.\\n(c) Draining fluids, abscesses, wounds, burns.\\n(d) Renal dialysis\\n\\n4. Increased metabolic needs due to\\n(a) Fever, (b) Recent surgery or trauma, (c) Extensive burns, infections\\n\\n5. Chronic disease or impaired function of a major organ system.\\n\\n6. Use of drugs with antinutrient properties\\n\\n7. Excessive intake of alcohol\\n\\n8. Faddism and other personal problems\\n\\nIatrogenic Malnutrition\\n\\nPatients who are hospitalised for 2 weeks or longer are at risk of developing iatrogenic (doctor\\nor hospital induced) malnutrition due to some of the factors mentioned above. These include insufficient\\nfood (hence nutrient) intake, stress, blood loss due to tests and surgery. For such patients, as also\\nothers, nutritional assessment and nutritional care are imperative.\\n\\nPlanning of Therapeutic Diets\\n\\nThe energy and protein needs need to be determined to ensure proper nutritional care of a\\nmalnourished patient.\\n\\nEnergy Needs : The energy intake has to meet the basal plus activity needs of the patient, taking\\ninto account the patient’s need for – repletion, maintenance or weight loss. The resting energy\\nexpenditure (REE)  can be measured with a portable equipment, which measures volumes of oxygen\\n(VO2) consumed and carbon dioxide expired (VCO2). The REE is increased in patient suffering from\\nburns, fevers, infection, fractures, trauma etc. and lowered in malnutrition.\\n\\nThe resting energy expenditure (REE) can also be determined using the classic Harris-Benedict\\nequation derived from indirect calorimetry measurements, using the weight, height and age of the\\npatient.\\n\\nHarris-Benedict Equation\\n\\n  Women: REE ( kcal ) = 655.1 + 9.56W + 1.85H - 4.68A\\n  Men: REE ( kcal) = 66.5 + 13.75W + 5.0H - 6.78A\\n  where A = Age in years, W = Weight in kgs, H = Height in cms\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinciples of Diet Therapy and Therapeutic Nutrition 265\\n\\nProtein Needs: Loss of nitrogen is increased by stress. If the losses in urine are measured, the\\nprotein intake can be increased to make up for the loss. When the loss is unknown, protein intake can\\nbe proportional to energy intake, as indicated below:\\n\\nCalorie : Nitrogen ratio in Severe stress is — 150 : 1 to 100 : 1\\nFor example, if a stressed patient needs 2400 kcalories, his N-need is–\\n2400 kcal = N(g) × 150 = 16.0 g N per day\\nProtein Needs = 16.0 × 6.25 = 100g per day\\n\\nTherapeutic Diets\\n\\nFood is an integral part of patient care and is a major contributor in his/her recovery. Therefore,\\ncareful selection of foods, their preparation and ensuring that these are consumed by the patient is an\\nimportant part of the therapy. The medical personnel are responsible for diagnosis and indicating the\\nkind of modifications to be made in the normal diet in view of the condition of the patient. The diet\\nsection staff use this information to plan the patient’s diet.\\n\\nThere are three aspects of the diets prescribed. The first refers to the composition of the diet.\\nThus it indicates modification in the components of the diet. For example, low calorie diet, indicates\\nthat the energy content of the diet is reduced. However, it is important to include a specific amount\\nintended to guide the user ( such as 1200 or 1500 calorie diet).\\n\\nSecond aspect refers to the consistency of the diet. Thus you have normal diet, liquid diet\\n(further classified into clear–liquid, full-liquid diet), soft diet, soft fiber-restricted diet, pureed diet, etc.\\n\\nThirdly, it is important to indicate the manner and route of feeding the diet, such as by mouth,\\nby nasogastric tube, gastrostomy tube etc., depending on the condition of the patient.\\n\\nTypes of Diets\\n\\nNormal Hospital Diet\\nNormal diet is the most commonly used diet in the hospitals. It plays a very important part in the\\n\\npatient’s recovery. It aims to meet the recommended dietary allowances of nutrients through a planned\\ndiet. There are no restrictions involved in food planning, but the food plan is balanced to avoid over- or\\nunder-nutrition. In the hospitals, there is choice of menu based on normal food acceptance patterns of\\nthe patients. Thus in India, the hospitals serve vegetarian and non-vegetarian diet. There may be some\\nchoice of foods in the menu, which helps to retain a feeling of control in the patient. Table 23.1 gives\\nfoods included in the normal diet.\\n\\nModifications of Normal Diet\\nThe normal diet is modified to form various diets according to the needs of the patient. These\\n\\ninclude various liquid and soft diets, which have been discussed in chapter 23.\\nLiquid Diets are further divided into Clear-liquid Diet and Full-liquid Diet. The details of\\n\\nfoods included in liquid diets are given in Chapter 23.\\nClear-liquid Diet or Clear-fluid Diet includes drinks such as tea, coffee,  clear fruit juices,\\n\\ncoconut water, sherbets, extracts of dal, rice, popped cereals, fat-free broth, carbonated drinks. Milk\\nis not included, as it is not a clear liquid. Feeds are offered in small portions of about 20-25 ml every\\nhour or two and the volume is increased gradually as the condition of the patient improves.\\n\\n\\n\\n266 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n1 or more servings\\n\\nLiquid diet helps to maintain liquid and electrolyte balance, relieve thirst and stimulate the digestion\\nsystem to function, after an operation or disturbance in the system due to infection. If the fluids are\\nchosen well, the diet can provide 200-500 kcal, some sodium, potassium and ascorbic acid. It does not\\nmeet the requirement of most nutrients and is given only for a day or two during a transient phase\\nbefore moving on to soft and then full diet.\\n\\nA clear-liquid diet is given :\\n(a) for a patient suffering from nausea, vomiting or loss of appetite (anorexia).\\n(b) during acute stage of diarrhea\\n(c) post-operative first stage,\\n(d) after tube or parenteral feeding before resuming oral feeding.\\nFull-liquid Diet: In full liquid diet, foods included are –liquids and foods which are liquid at body\\n\\ntemperature. It can provide adequate nutrition, with the exception of iron. As the nutrient-density is not\\nhigh, six or more feedings are given. Skim milk powder is added to increase the protein content of the\\ndiet. This increases the lactose content of the diet and therefore, it should not be given to persons with\\nlow lactase activity. This diet has high calcium and fat content and is low in fiber. The foods which can\\nbe included in full-liquid diet are listed in Chapter 23.\\n\\nTable 24.3 Daily Food Allowances for the Full Liquid Diet\\n\\nDaily Food Plan Description\\n\\nI Cereal Group One half cup strained, cooked cereal\\ncontains about 80 calories, 2g protein,\\niron and the B complex vitamins.\\nCombine with milk in gruels and soups.\\n\\nII Protein Group\\nMilk\\n 1 ¼ liter fluid cow’s milk One and quarter liter fluid cow’s milk\\n\\ncontains about 40g protein and 820\\ncalories, 2.5g calcium, day’s need of\\nvitamin A and B vitamins.\\n\\n¼ C skimmed milk powder (SMP) If ¼ C skimmed milk powder is added to\\ncow’s milk, about 8g protein and 80\\ncalories will be added.

To reduce indigestible carbohydrates, pureed vegetables and fruits or only the juice\\nof vegetables and fruits is used.\\n\\nRecent trend is a more liberal one as patients prefer and are happier with soft cooked immature\\nvegetables than with pureed ones. Use of a wider variety of fruits and vegetables, including some raw\\nfruits is the trend now. For example, peeled apples, pears, peaches, apricots and bananas are often\\nrecommended to be used.\\n\\nA description of the daily food allowances and sample menu for soft fiber-restricted diet is\\npresented in Table 24.7. Appropriate adaptations can be made in this plan can be made to meet individual\\nrequirements\\n\\nSome of the aspects that affect food acceptability include connective tissue, strong flavour and\\nthe amount of stimulant present.\\n\\nTable 24.7 Food Allowances and Sample Menu for Soft Fiber-Restricted Diet\\n\\nFood Allowances Sample Menu\\n\\nI. Cereal foods: Well-cooked, soft rice, chapati, Idli,\\nporridge (rawa), kheer, bread, bhakari, Senvaya,\\nnoodles, macaroni, spaghetti\\nII Dal, well-cooked, like varan, soup\\nMilk, cow’s, curd, buttermilk, soft cheese\\nEggs- All preparations, except fried\\nMeat- fish- poultry – very tender, minced or\\nground, baked, roasted or stewed\\n\\nIII Vegetables: tender greens, cooked and blended\\nIV If not tender, strained cooked vegetables, cooked\\n\\ntender beets, carrots, peas, pumpkin, squash and Other\\ngourds, without seeds and skin\\nFruits: raw: banana, papaya, citrus fruits without\\nmembrane, chiku, water melon, mango Cooked apples.\\nPears, peaches, apricots – all  without skins; all juices\\n\\nV Sugars: syrup, honey, jelly, sugar candy (without nuts\\nand fruits), molasses. Use in moderation\\nFats: cream, butter, ghee, vegetable oils. Use in\\nmoderation\\nIn addition one can include –\\nBeverages – all,\\nDesserts : mithai without nuts and dry fruits, kheer –\\nrice, rawa, shenvaya etc. Plain cakes, biscuits, custard,\\nice-cream, sherbet, puddings\\nMiscellaneous: salt, seasonings & spices in moderation\\n\\nConnective Tissue : The texture of meat, tender or less tender is mainly decided by the amount\\nof connective tissue present. The amount of connective tissue in meat depends on the age of the animal\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinciples of Diet Therapy and Therapeutic Nutrition 271\\n\\nand how much the muscle is exercised. The acceptance of meat preparations can be improved by\\ncooking. Meat may be made tender by using moist heat and lower temperature cookery.\\n\\nFlavour – Strong flavoured vegetables such as onions, leeks, radishes, dried beans and cabbage\\nfamily vegetables ( brussel sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, turnips) are normally omitted. But there is\\nindividual variation in patients’ acceptance of these. Hence the individual patient’s preference needs to\\nbe considered in this matter.\\n\\nThe effects of spices on the digestive system have been studied. It is found that cinnamon,\\nallspice, thyme, sage, mace, paprika and caraway, used to flavour foods, do not have harmful effect.\\nBut black pepper, chilli pepper, cloves, mustard seed and perhaps nutmeg are considered gastric irritants\\nand best avoided.\\n\\nBeverages: Both tea and coffee are stimulating beverages. When these are used in the diet, one\\nneeds to know how to prepare these to avoid undesirable side effects on the other components.\\n\\nA mild cup of tea (from ½ tsp dried leaves) contains about 0.05g caffeine, but quick infusion\\nextracts most of the caffeine, but not the tannins. As tannins precipitate proteins, a quick infusion is\\nrecommended for use in the diet.\\n\\nCoffee contains an average of 1.25% caffeine. A cup of strong coffee contains about 0.1g of\\ncaffeine. Besides caffeine, coffee contains chlorogenic acid, which differs from tannins in that it does\\nnot precipitate proteins and is not astringent. Cocoa contains 31% carbohydrate, 9% protein and 10%\\nfat. It contains about 1.5% theobromine and a trace of caffeine, both being stimulants.\\n\\nNutrient Content: In the past, it was common practice to put more emphasis on “foods to\\navoid” and less on “foods to eat”. It led to this group of diets being one of the hazards of hospitalization,\\nresulting in nutritional deficiency and delay in recovery. Such deficiency can be avoided by proper\\nselection and use of correct amount of foods in the diet.\\n\\nFoods from the first four groups may be used in amounts enough to meet or exceed RDAs. This\\nis very important for persons, who have been ill for sometime, and may have suffered due to undue\\ndietary restrictions. In addition, the disease itself may increase nutritional needs to ensure healing of\\ntissue or to make up for poor absorption. Such extra needs would justify increased intake of foods\\nfrom all the food groups. For example, if this diet is used to reduce gastric acidity, additional amounts\\nof protein containing foods such as milk need to be taken. The protein content of milk can be increased\\nby addition of skimmed milk powder to it. The number of meals may be increased to six or more\\nfeedings per day, to buffer the acid produced in the stomach.\\n\\nThe amount of protein foods, citrus juice and other foods need to be increased to exceed the\\namounts suggested for a normal individual. As personal needs vary, special adaptations can be made to\\nsuit the person.\\n\\nA description of the daily food allowances and sample menu pattern is presented in table 24.7.\\nAppropriate adaptations can be made in this plan to meet individual requirements.\\n\\nTube Feeding\\n\\nIf a patient whose gastrointestinal tract is working, cannot take sufficient food orally, tube feeding\\nis resorted to. Tube feeding is given in the following conditions –\\n\\n(i) Babies who have low birth weight and cannot suck\\n(ii) Those who are undernourished and cannot take or retain food taken orally\\n\\n(iii) Persistent anorexia patients, who need forced feeding\\n\\n\\n\\n272 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n(iv) After certain types of surgery\\n(v) Patients with severe malabsorption\\n\\n(vi) Patients who cannot absorb or digest food\\n(vii) Semiconscious or unconscious patients or any other condition which prevents intake of\\n\\nsufficient food.\\nSince the feed must be formulated to meet the nutritional needs of the patient, it is also called\\n\\nformula feed. It is important that the formula should be such that it is well tolerated. Many types of\\nformulas can be made or purchased to serve the needs of the patient. The foods fed by tube may be :\\n\\n(i) Natural liquid foods\\n(ii) Raw or cooked foods blended to liquid form, or\\n\\n(iii) Commercially made special formulated diets.\\n\\nComposition\\nThe form of proteins in the formula can be intact proteins (milk, egg ) or protein hydrolysates\\n\\ncontaining peptides and amino acids. When the patient has normal enzymatic digestive function\\n(absorption) intact proteins are included in the formula. But if there is severe lack of enzyme or\\nmalabsorption, protein hydrolysates are used in the formula.\\n\\nCarbohydrate is in the form of polymers of glucose, which are easily broken and absorbed.\\nStarch or disaccharides (sucrose or lactose0 may also be used. Lactose is avoided in many ready-made\\nformulas because in some problems of absorption, lactose is not tolerated.\\n\\nFats used in the formulas are vegetable oils, butter, lecithin, mono- and diglycerides and medium\\nchain triglycerides (MCT). Formulas are fortified with vitamins and minerals to ensure adequate nutrition.\\n\\nFormulas normally provide 1kcal/ml. Formulas are likely to be low in fiber, unless enriched with\\nfiber.\\n\\nOsmolality\\nThe number and size of particles per kg of water is called Osmolality This is an important factor\\n\\nin deciding patient tolerance. Isotonic formulas as the word indicates, have the same osmolality as\\nbody fluids and are well tolerated. Hyper-osmoler formulas (with higher osmolality) may cause rapid\\nmovement of fluid and electrolytes across the cell wall, if these are introduced in the intestine.\\n\\nAny formula which has a high level of electrolytes has high osmolality. Thus glucose and sucrose\\nhave higher osmolality than complex carbohydrates; free amino acids have higher osmolality than\\nintact proteins; fat has little effect. It is good to remember that carbohydrates have the greatest influence\\non osmolality, because they are digested very rapidly.\\n\\nTypes of Formulas\\nNames of formulas indicate their components and their nutritional make-up. Thus Balanced\\n\\nComplete Formulas are made from ordinary foods or baby foods by blending these. These can be\\nmade at home or in hospital.\\n\\nA milk-based formula is prepared from cow’s, toned or skim milk with addition of pasteurised\\neggs, a source of carbohydrate and supplements of vitamins.\\n\\nLactose-free formulas  are made for lactose-sensitive patients.\\nSpeciality formulas  are made for specific conditions, with the needed adjustments in nutrient\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinciples of Diet Therapy and Therapeutic Nutrition 273\\n\\ncontent. For example, high fat and low carbohydrate formulas are made for pulmonary conditions; for\\nphenylketonuria, a formula low or devoid of phenylalanine is given. In trauma or liver disease, a formula\\nlow in aromatic amino acids and high in branched chain amino acids is given.\\n\\nThe mode of administration of formula is decided taking patient’s condition and the period for\\nwhich tube feed is to be given. For short term feeding nasogastric tube is used.\\n\\nWhen there is injury to the esophagus or for long term tube feeding, a gastrostomy tube may be\\nsurgically inserted into the stomach. This route is not suitable for patients with unchecked vomiting or\\nwhere gastric emptying is disturbed. A jejunostomy tube may be used when the stomach must be\\nbypassed.\\n\\nThe feeding can be continuous or intermittent. Intermittent feeding permits patient to move about.\\nLike all other diets, diluted formulas are fed in the beginning and gradually concentration is\\n\\nincreased to full strength. The rate of feeding is begun slowly and then increased gradually. This\\ndecreases the possibility of diarrhea. The patient’s bed (head side) is raised while feeding, to reduce\\nchance of air block.\\n\\nHome Tube Feeding\\nLong term tube feeding can be given at home, with guidance from the health care team. The care-\\n\\nprovider needs to be given instructions about how to maintain sanitation and hygiene in handling feeds\\nand the equipment used.\\n\\nParenteral Nutrition\\nIn parenteral feeding, the nutrient preparations are given directly into a vein. When a patient is\\n\\nlikely to be dehydrated and needs quick reversal of the condition, a 5% dextrose solution in water\\n(DSW) is usually given by a peripheral vein (also known as IV drip) to provide fluids and some energy\\n(calories). Electrolyte solutions can also be given by this mode. In some conditions the higher dextrose\\nconcentrations with amino acids and lipids are given.\\n\\nTotal Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)\\nTPN is used only when it is not possible to use enteral route and the patient is hypermetabolic or\\n\\ndebilitated. Before giving TPN, a thorough nutritional and metabolic assessment of the patient is done.\\nThe blood levels of various nutrients are monitored frequently during TPN and the solution adjusted, if\\nneeded.\\n\\nComposition of Solutions: Crystalline amino acids are used to meet protein needs, so that the\\ncomposition can be controlled to meet patient’s needs. Dextrose solutions (hypertonic) provide\\ncarbohydrates as energy source and ensure amino acid sparing action. For patients with lung problems,\\nhigh dextrose load causes difficulty in breathing. For such patients part of the carbohydrate is replaced\\nwith fat, to prevent this problem.\\n\\nEmulsions of safflower or soy oil are given separately, to meet part of the energy needs and to\\nprovide essential fatty acids.. As lipid emulsions are isotonic, these are given by central or peripheral\\nvein. Other nutrients (vitamins, minerals and other electrolytes) are given in solution or by injection.\\n\\nTPN solutions being hypertonic are introduced into a large central vein where the solution gets\\ndiluted quickly in the high rate of blood flow.\\n\\nThe patient should be helped to return to oral feeding as soon as feasible, as TPN is expensive and\\ncan lead to a number of complications, if not given properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n274 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nHome Care of Patients\\n\\nThe family could be guided to take care of the patient’s nutrition at home. Thus over 25 per cent\\nof nursing home residents could be taken care of at home.

The\\nnutritional needs of the body are increased to resist the pathogen, to recoup the losses incurred\\nmetabolically and rebuild the cells damaged by the invader. Hence a high protein diet is indicated.\\n\\nInfections\\n\\nInfection occurs when a pathogen gains entry into the body in sufficient numbers or multiplies in\\nthe body and causes injury at a particular site. Depending on where the pathogen attacks, different\\ntypes of illnesses develop. If a pathogen enters through the nose or mouth, and multiplies in that region,\\nailments of throat or bronchi occur. If pathogens enter the lungs, it can injure them. If pathogens are\\nswallowed with water, milk or food, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, cramps and\\ndiarrhea frequently result. If the pathogens enter through cut skin, infections such as boils, skin ulcers\\nor other inflammations occur.\\n\\nThe severity of the infection depends on the number of pathogens in the body and the body’s\\nability to fight the infection. The ability of the body to resist infection is called immunity. Natural\\nimmunity is the sum-total of the defenses in the body which enables the body to resist infection under\\nnormal conditions. These defenses include –\\n\\n• intact skin and mucous membranes, which bar entrance of microorganisms\\n• tissue fluids and blood, which contain cells and other substances which engulf and destroy\\n\\nforeign objects, and\\n\\n\\n\\n276 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n• the normally harmless population of bacteria and viruses found in the body, which prevent\\nthe growth of harmful bacteria and viruses.\\n\\nAll these processes of normal immunity depend on proper nutrition, physical fitness and\\nenvironmental conditions. When this natural immunity is depressed by poor nutritional status and other\\nconditions, a person may develop infections. If the person is in poor nutritional state, an attack of\\ncommon infectious diseases can endanger life itself.\\n\\nA patient who is in poor nutritional status needs nutrient supplements.\\nIn severe infections, nutritional status is affected in an adverse manner. Thus the food intake and\\n\\nabsorption are reduced, while nutrient excretion is increased, metabolic rate also increases. Nutrients\\nare diverted to minimize effect of infection and resist damage to tissues. Higher nutrient intake must be\\nplanned to ensure tissue repair and to make up for excretory losses.\\n\\nInfection involves protein breakdown and hence there is an increased need for dietary proteins.\\nThe first goal is to identify and destroy the pathogen causing infection. The antibiotics, which are given\\nto control the infection, may cause gastrointestinal disturbances  which need to be taken into account\\nin the diet management.\\n\\nFever\\n\\nFever often accompanies infection. The patient may have chills due to fever and may complain of\\nfeeling cold. But all fevers are not a result of infection. All elevations in body temperature are not fever.\\nFor example, there is elevation of body temperature in heat stroke, as the body is unable to eliminate\\nheat.\\n\\nInfection affects protein catabolism (breakdown), often decreases food intake and increases\\nnutrient loss through vomiting and/or diarrhea. Enteric(intestinal) infections, as in typhoid, interfere\\nwith absorption and reduce nutrient utilization. Fever, which often accompanies infection, increases\\nenergy needs of the body (about 7% per degree Fahrenheit) above normal temperature.\\n\\nFever may be acute and of short duration as in colds, intermittent as in malaria or chronic as in\\ntuberculosis.\\n\\nDiet: The dietary treatment varies with the kind of fever and its duration. When fever is acute and\\nof short duration, the most important aspect is to feed sufficient fluids and electrolytes to make up for\\nthe losses from the body. As appetite is usually poor, frequent small feeds of liquid and soft foods need\\nto be given to ensure adequate intake. As the condition improves, the size of the feed is increased to\\nmeet nutritional needs.\\n\\nThe critical problem is protein breakdown, which occurs in infection. A high protein, high calorie\\ndiet is prescribed (Table 25.1). Liquid and soft foods need to be fed often to ensure sufficient food\\nintake as appetite is poor.  Food allowances for such a diet are indicated in table 25.2.\\n\\nThe drugs given (antipyretics) help to bring the temperature to normal. Most of the drugs contain\\ningredients to relieve pain also. The medication is taken with food to minimise gastric irritation.\\n\\nTuberculosis\\n\\nIn India, tuberculosis is a major cause of illness and death. According to one estimate, one in four\\nIndians is infected by T.B.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Infections, Fever and Lung Diseases 277\\n\\nTable 25.1 High Protein High Calorie Diet\\n\\nProtein 75g; Kcal 2,500  Protein 110g; Kcal 3,000\\n\\nFood  Amt/Serving Protein Kcal Food Amt/Serving Protein Kcal\\n\\nMilk,toned 800ml 26 535 Milk,toned 1000ml 32 670\\nEgg 1 no 6 75 Egg 1 no 6 75\\nCheese/ 2 S 9 133 Cheese/ 4 S 18 265\\nPaneer/meat Paneer/meat\\nDal 2 S  11 170  Dal 3 S 17 255\\nCereals, 6 S  15 510 Cereals, 12 S 30 1,020\\nBreads Breads\\nVegetables 3-4 S 5 100 Vegetables 3-4 S 5 100\\nFruits 3  S 1 180 Fruits 3 S 1 100\\nGhee 9 S 0 405 Ghee 5S 0 225\\nButter/oil Butter/oil\\nSugar 10 S 0 200 Sugar 5 S 0 100\\nJam etc. Jam etc\\nTotal 75 2,508 Total 110 2,990\\n\\nTuberculosis is caused by the bacteria  Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is transmitted through the\\ncough or sneeze of an infected person, when it gets sprayed into the air. Most people who breathe in\\nthe bacteria do not get infected. In those who do not get infected even after inhaling the bacteria, the\\nmicroorganisms may remain dormant as their immune system triggers activation of macrophages,\\nwhich engulf the bacteria. About 10 per cent of those infected develop tuberculosis some time in their\\nlife, when the natural immunity is lowered.\\n\\nIn tuberculosis, lungs are the most frequently affected part, but other organs may be attacked\\nsometimes. Tuberculosis ( T.B. ) is accompanied by cough, sneezing, fever and tissue wastage. In\\nacute form, the fever is high and the symptoms are similar to pneumonia. Low grade fever is typical of\\nthe chronic form.\\n\\nBody’s Metabolic Response: Ability to utilise fat is reduced, hence muscle protein losses are\\nincreased. As available nitrogen is used to synthesize immune bodies, considerable protein wasting\\noccurs with loss of body weight.\\n\\nDiet: A high protein, high calorie diet is prescribed. It must provide sufficient energy i.e. about\\n2500-3000 calories and 75-100g protein (Table 25.2). A sample menu and foods included are given in\\ntable 25.3. In addition, if there has been lung haemorrhage, iron supplement with large intake of vitamin\\nC is needed. As carotenes are not utilised well, preformed vitamin A must be included in the diet. In\\naddition, vitamin A and vitamin B6 supplements must also be given.\\n\\nIsoniazid, a drug, which is prescribed for T.B., is a Vitamin B6 antagonist. Hence vitamin B6\\nsupplements must be given to avoid its deficiency.\\n\\n\\n\\n278 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nTable 25.2  Food Allowances for High Calorie, High Protein Diet\\n\\nProtein – 75 to 110g and Kcal 2,500 to 3,100\\n\\nGroup Foods No. of Servings, amount\\n\\nI Cereals, breads 6 – 12 S  (150 – 300g)\\n\\nII.

One\\nof the problems in the control of tuberculosis is the fact that patients tend to neglect medication, as\\nsoon as they feel a little better. This leads to its recurrence. Education of patients about the need for\\nprolonged treatment and monitoring until complete recovery is an important part of the control of\\ntuberculosis.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Infections, Fever and Lung Diseases 279\\n\\nIt is very important to take the drug and diet treatment consistently until the patient is fully back\\nto normal health. Failure to do so results in recurrence of the disease; the resistant bacteria, which\\ncause the second attack, are hardy and hard to treat.\\n\\nAsthma, Chronic Bronchitis and Emphysema\\n\\nAsthma, chronic bronchitis and emphysema are grouped together as Chronic Obstructive\\nPulmonary Disease (COPD). The group has a common characteristic, which is air-flow reduction or\\nobstruction. A lot of attention is given to its pathophysiology, but the nutrition aspect of treatment does\\nnot receive adequate attention.\\n\\nThere are about 300 million air-sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The symptoms of injury are noticed\\nonly after 60 per cent of these air sacs are affected. The symptoms and possible causes of COPD\\nare given in Table 25.4.\\n\\nA very large number of Indians suffer from these ailments. A large percentage of annual deaths\\nfrom chronic bronchitis and emphysema are due to excessive smoking cigarettes or bidis.\\n\\nTable 25.4  Characteristics of COPD\\n\\nDisease Symptoms\\n\\nAsthma increased response of trachea and\\nbronchi to stimuli, airways reduced,\\nswelling of airway wall, excess mucus,\\nwheezing, coughing, difficulty in\\nbreathing.\\n\\nChronic bronchitis excess mucus, inflamed airways,\\nhyperactive bronchi, difficulty in\\nbreathing out\\n\\nEmphysema reduced lung surface area, destruction\\nof air sacs and air spaces in lungs,\\nwheezing, chronic cough, chest shape\\ndistorted to barrel shape due to\\noverwork and over-inflation of muscles\\n\\nNutritional Status: Nutritional status is poor and weight loss is noted. Breathing difficulties do\\nnot permit normal eating. The sputum formed affects tastes adversely. Due to insufficient oxygen\\nsupply, peristalsis is reduced resulting in poor appetite. In addition the drugs given to improve breathing\\ncause gastric irritation. In severe cases, the low oxygen supply and side effects of drugs may lead to\\nulcer formation in the stomach in about 20-25% of the patients.\\n\\nTreatment: Avoidance of predisposing factors is an important part of cure. Dust allergy is one\\nof the most common causes of asthma. The mites present in dust which have been found to be the\\n\\n\\n\\n280 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ncause, have to be removed by frequent washing of bed sheets and pillow covers, wet wiping of floors\\nand fans and vacuum cleaning the books, papers and other articles, which the patient has to handle in\\ndaily life.\\n\\nDiet Therapy: The first aim in diet therapy is to prevent malnutrition or correct it if it has\\noccurred. The energy needs increase many fold  in comparison to normal needs of a person of\\ncomparable age and size. In extreme COPD cases, the energy used for breathing can be 10 times  that\\nof the normal rate.\\n\\nEnergy: Energy needs need to be met; but intake must be monitored  to  match the oxygen\\navailable. Thus one can avoid production of excess carbon dioxide which may cause acidosis. These\\npatients have limited ability to excrete carbon dioxide, so diet must contain foods with low respiratory\\nquotient (RQ). RQ of fats is 0.7, proteins 0.8 and carbohydrates 1.0. So non-protein calories can be\\nprovided by high fat to carbohydrate ratio, which will decrease carbon dioxide production. Such\\nformulas are available to treat severe cases.\\n\\nPlan of Meal Times: Rest before meals helps to improve intake of food. Slow, deep breathing\\nand relaxation practice helps eating. It also helps to avoid swallowing air, which can disrupt flow of\\nfood. Eating small meals slowly, wearing loose garments, not lying down, bending over or exercising\\nsoon after meals are helpful. Small frequent meals helps to reduce anorexia and decrease pressure on\\nstomach due to fullness. It permits free movement of diaphragm and decreases fatigue.\\n\\nSome drugs used to dilate bronchi have caffeine – like side effects, so caffeine should be avoided\\nby patients on such days. To avoid undesirable side effects, it is advisable to take medicines with food.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. What is infection?  What is natural immunity?\\n2.

Anything that affects its function disturbs this process\\nand leads to disease.\\n\\nThe gastrointestinal tract consists of esophagus (food tube), stomach (mixes food and forms\\nchyme) , small intestine  (small diameter tube 20 ft. long, consisting of the duodenum, the jejunum\\nand the ileum) and large intestine  (large diameter tube which includes cecum, colon, rectum and\\nanal canal).\\n\\nThe food is ground in the stomach into tiny particles. The stomach secretes mucous to protect\\nthe lining of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition it also secretes hydrochloric acid and several enzymes\\nand readies the food for digestion by changing it into semifluid chyme. The pancreas  secrete pancreatic\\njuice into the duodenum to facilitate the digestion of the food in the small intestine. Food products\\ncarried by blood vessels from the walls of the digestive tube are delivered to the liver, the largest organ\\nin the digestive system (Fig. 25.1).\\n\\nThe dietary factors associated with ailments of the gastrointestinal tract (G.I.) are:\\n(i) Acidity, (ii) inadequate fiber, (iii) fat,  ( iv) substances such as gluten in wheat and (v) lactose.\\nOne more substance  - alcohol – does affect the health of the G.I. tract adversely. But it is not a\\n\\nfood, nor is it a dietary essential.\\n\\n\\n\\n282 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 26.1 The gastrointestinal tract\\n\\nGeneral Aspects of Digestion\\n\\nFood and Gastric Acidity :  Foods normally have a pH of 5 to 7, while the pH of acid (hydrochloric)\\nsecreted in gastric juices in the stomach is less than 2. The pH of citrus fruits and other acid tasting\\nfoods is about 3.5 or more. Therefore, no food is acid enough to change the acidity of the stomach\\ncontents. This is very important information and needs to be given to patients who suffer from acidity,\\nso that they will not avoid vitamin C rich foods and develop vitamin C deficiency.\\n\\nProtein-rich foods neutralise gastric acid. Milk is therefore the food of choice used to treat\\nacidity. Its neutralising effect lasts for half to two hours. Fat reduces acid production and decreases\\nmotility. Hence addition of cream to milk was used to treat peptic ulcer. But the use needs to be\\nmoderated to avoid the risk of atherosclerosis due to the saturated fats in cream.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Diseases of the Gastrointestinal Tract 283\\n\\nStimulants increase the production of gastric acid. Hence these need to be avoided by persons\\nsuffering from acidity. The stimulants to be avoided include tea, coffee, alcohol, tobacco, meat extracts\\nin soups and gravies and spices – chilli powder, black pepper, mustard seeds, nutmeg.\\n\\nConstipation\\n\\nAccording to a  research survey in Mumbai, over 70 per cent of the persons studied complained\\nof constipation.\\n\\nPersons, who have little or no exercise especially elderly persons, suffer from atonic constipation.\\nThey limit their food selection to soft, low-fiber foods; they limit fluid intake to prevent urination,\\nespecially at night. They become dependent on laxatives and yet find no relief, as the causative factors\\nare not eliminated.\\n\\nTreatment: The following changes in routine and diet help to get rid of the constipation:\\n(i) Increase fluid intake to 1200 to 1500ml. i.e., 5 to 6 glasses of water  in addition to other\\n\\nbeverages and liquid foods (soups, buttermilk, etc.)\\n(ii)  Include 200 to 250g of vegetables and fruits in the diet and\\n\\n(iii)   Exercise regularly e.g., walking  ¾  to 1 hour daily,\\n(iv)  Do fitness exercises, and/or\\n(v)   Suryanamasksars  or  yoga  daily.\\n\\nDiet: Their diet needs to be modified gradually to high fiber diet as listed below :\\n1. Eat whole wheat chapati and bhakari as major part of the meal and reduce intake of white\\n\\nbread and polished rice\\n2. Include cooked preparations of germinated pulses in the diet.\\n3. Take two or more servings of cooked vegetables such as cluster and other beans, gourds\\n\\n(snake, ridge, bitter, sponge, etc.)\\n4. Eat raw vegetables such as cabbage, carrot, cucumber, tomatoes, radish etc.\\n5. Include two or more servings of fruits such as amla, banana, papaya, chiku,  guava, melons,\\n\\njackfruit, berries, apples, etc.\\n6. Take beverages such as buttermilk, lemon squash, mango panhe, kokum drink, to increase\\n\\nfluid intake.\\n 7. Drink  5 to 6 glasses of water, as a drink to ensure movement of food in the  digestive  tract\\n\\nand smooth elimination of waste   products.\\nThe changes in the diet must be introduced gradually to avoid feeling of bloating or cramping due\\n\\nto the changes.\\n\\nDiarrhoea\\n\\nDiarrhoea is one of the most common G.I. tract ailments. It is still the second most common\\ncause of death in childhood, killing over 1.5 million children in India alone.\\n\\nThe occurrence of diarrhoea indicates that there is contamination of food and water with virus\\nand bacteria from human faeces. In diarrhoea, the stools are liquid or semisolid and large volumes of\\nthese are passed frequently. There is also vomiting, cramps and abdominal pain. The food passes\\n\\n\\n\\n284 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nthrough the gastrointestinal tract so rapidly that its digestion and absorption is reduced. The fecal\\nmatter moves through the colon so fast that water and electrolytes are not reabsorbed.\\n\\nFrequent and/or prolonged attacks result in loss of fluids, electrolytes, minerals, vitamins, proteins,\\nfats, carbohydrates and as a result there is loss of body weight. This leads to dehydration.\\n\\nTherapy: The first step is to identify the cause and remove it. If diarrhoea is severe and dehydration\\nhas set in (eyes sunken, skin loose and inelastic, passing reduced amounts of dark urine), fluids and\\nelectrolytes may be first given intravenously to let the gastrointestinal tract to rest. This is followed by\\nfeeding fluids, with gradual move to oral rehydration therapy and later to a very low residue diet.\\n(Tables 26.1 and  26.2)\\n\\nTable 26.1   WHO Formula for Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)\\n\\nSodium chloride 3.5g Dissolve in one liter\\nSodium bicarbonate 2.5g boiled, cooled water. Do not boil after dissolving\\nPotassium chloride 1.5g these  ingredients in water\\nGlucose 20.0g\\n\\nDirections for use of ORS:\\n1. Use a clean cup and spoon\\n2. For infants, use a dropper. Babies who are breastfed, should continue to be breastfed\\n\\nin addition to ORS\\n3. Let the patient sip the liquid from the spoon, not drink it.\\n4. Feed one cup for each stool passed\\n5. Even if the patient vomits, in the first couple of hours continue to feed ORS in small\\n\\nsips\\n\\nIf oral rehydration mixture is not available, use a home-made one containing sugar (40g), and salt\\n(3.5 g) per liter supplemented with potassium rich foods such as coconut water, lemon juice, banana,\\nmashed papaya, mashed plantains etc.\\n\\nLow Residue Diet\\n\\nOral rehydration therapy is followed by a very low residue diet in cases of severe diarrhoea. The\\nlow residue diet of less than 10g of fiber a day reduces the normal work of the intestines by restricting\\nthe amount of dietary fiber and reducing food residue. Food residue is the bulk in colon that includes\\nundigested food, intestinal secretions, bacteria and cells shed from the intestinal lining. The foods\\nallowed and foods avoided in low residue soft diet are listed in Table 26.2. It consists mainly of liquids\\nsuch as buttermilk, dal soup, broth, vegetable and fruit juices, coconut water, etc. some soft foods\\nsuch as soft cooked dal, cooked eggs, pureed mild-flavoured vegetables, apple sauce, fruit pulsp ,\\nrefined breads, soft cooked rice, custards, kheers, etc. can gradually be added to improve the nutrient\\ncontent, as the condition of the patient improves and appetite slowly recovers.\\n\\nThe patient needs to progress  from liquid diet, soft diet to normal diet gradually. Contamination\\nof food must be prevented to avoid recurrence of diarrhoea.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Diseases of the Gastrointestinal Tract 285\\n\\nTable 26.2 Foods Allowed and Avoided in Low Residue Diet\\n\\nFoods Allowed Foods Avoided\\n\\nButtermilk, (2 C only) Whole milk\\n\\nDal soup and soft cooked dal\\n\\nEggs (all but fried) Legumes, nuts, fried foods,\\n\\nSoups and soup broth Fibrous meat\\n\\nVegetable juices  and cooked or Vegetable and fruit fiber\\npureed mild-flavoured vegetables,\\ndudhi, pumpkin\\n\\nFruit juices, banana, apple sauce, Pickles, preserves\\nFruit pulp (papaya, melons etc.)\\n\\nCoconut water\\n\\nRefined breads, soft cooked rice, Coarse cereals and breads\\nnoodles, chapatti, etc. Whole grain breads\\n\\nKheer, jelly, custard, biscuits, plain cakes\\n\\nTea, coffee if allowed\\n\\nFood Tolerance\\n\\nFood tolerance is highly an individual reaction to intake of various foods. Some persons suffer\\nfrom heartburn, flatulence and distention of abdomen, when they consume certain foods. Tolerance to\\nsuch foods is highly an individual reaction and needs to be treated as such. The foods mentioned as\\ncause of the discomfort include dry beans and split dals of redgram, bengal gram and sometimes black\\ngram. Among the vegetables, strong flavoured ones containing sulfur compounds such as cabbage,\\ncauliflower, leeks, onions, radishes and turnips are mentioned. Some persons cannot tolerate even\\ncucumbers and watermelon. It is important to record the diet history of the patients, including their\\nperceived food tolerance, before preparing a diet plan for treating them.\\n\\nPersons, who are nervous, tense, too worried, insecure, feeling neglected and/or anxious, tend to\\nsuffer from gastrointestinal ailments. Their emotions affect the function of the digestive tract adversely.\\nOther factors noted are:\\n\\n(i) irregular  eating hours,\\n(ii) quick gulping down of food and hence poor mastication,\\n\\n(iii) lack of rest and\\n(iv) lack of rational schedule.\\nLuckily there is a wide choice of foods available in each food group and it is possible to plan a\\n\\nnutritionally adequate diet, using foods, which are well tolerated by the patient.\\nIn view of the above, in treating patients suffering from gastrointestinal ailments, diet plan needs\\n\\nto be individualized.\\n\\n\\n\\n286 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIn addition to a diet plan, the persons need to be helped to modify their thinking to accept their\\nduties rationally,  plan their day’s schedule of work and food intake. Stress should be reduced. They\\nneed to be guided to have regular times for meals, a short period before and after eating for relaxation\\nand sufficient time for each meal to permit eating slowly.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

Liver serves as our body’s internal chemical power plant. The health of the\\nliver is a major factor in the quality of our life.\\n\\nFunctions of Liver\\n\\nSome important functions of liver are:\\n• to convert carbohydrates in the food to stored energy and chemicals necessary for life and\\n\\ngrowth,\\n• to manufacture proteins, metabolise proteins, absorb fat products and make them available\\n\\nas fuel; produce  bile, essential for the digestion of fats and stored in the gall bladder.\\n• to store iron, copper and other minerals for use in the metabolism.\\n• to ensure storage, absorption and function of fat soluble vitamins A, D, E and K and their\\n\\nprecursors\\n• to act as filter to remove alcohol and toxic substances from the blood and convert them to\\n\\nsubstances that can be excreted from the body\\n• to process drugs and medications absorbed from the digestive system, enabling the body to\\n\\nuse them effectively and dispose of them.\\n\\n\\n\\n288 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nThus the liver manufactures proteins, processes carbohydrates, absorbs fat products and makes\\nthem available as fuel. The liver serves as a storehouse of vitamins and minerals and processes iron for\\nthe blood system. It dispatches sugars to tissues to burn to provide energy. Lastly it detoxifies any\\npoison that may enter the bloodstream and renders it harmless. Gall bladder is the store of a number of\\nessential chemicals in digestion including bile (Figure 27.1).\\n\\nA number of reactions in the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and fats take place in the\\nliver. Iron, copper and other minerals are stored in the liver.  Important reactions which ensure storage\\nand function of fat soluble vitamins A, D, K and their precursors take place in the liver. Liver is also\\ninvolved in detoxification of harmful  substances (including poison) and alcohol metabolism.\\n\\nAs much as 85-90% of the blood that leaves the stomach and intestines carries important nutrients\\nto the liver, where these are converted into substances the body can use. Carbohydrates or sugars are\\nstored as glycogen in the liver and are released as energy between meals or when the body’s energy\\ndemands are high. In this way, the liver helps to regulate the blood sugar level and prevent hypoglycemia\\nor low blood sugar. This enables us to keep an even level of energy throughout the day.\\n\\nFigure 27.1 The G.I. tract showing liver(7), Gallbladder and pancreas(8)\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Diseases of Liver, Gallbladder and Pancreas 289\\n\\nLiver and biliary system diseases are caused by infections (virus, bacteria and parasites), toxic\\nchemicals, alcohol intake, poor nutrition and metabolic disorders.\\n       Any injury to liver disturbs the body’s capacity to use food nutrients and has a devastating effect\\non the well being of the person.\\n\\nJaundice\\nJaundice is characterised by yellow colour of skin and tissues. In jaundice, the blood levels of bile\\n\\npigments are high. This is a frequent sign of liver and biliary tract diseases.\\nTherapy: The primary aim is to protect the liver from further stress and help it to function as\\n\\nnormally as feasible. Therefore, a nutritionally adequate diet is basic to avoid permanent damage.\\nDiet:  The modification of diet is based on:\\n(a) Generous intake of good quality protein to regenerate tissues and prevent fatty infiltration\\n(b) High carbohydrate intake to spare protein and synthesis of glycogen\\n(c) A  moderate fat restriction\\n(d) providing  vitamin supplements and\\n(e) ensuring sodium restriction,  if there is edema.\\n\\nHepatitis\\nIn this disease, liver is inflamed and degeneration may have occurred. There are four types  of\\n\\nhepatitis - A, B, C and D. In all these, the symptoms are similar. The symptoms  are loss of appetite,\\nnausea, abdominal pain, vomitting, diarrhoea, fever and loss of weight. Jaundice follows, if these\\nsymptoms are not treated promptly by diet modification.\\n\\nDiet: In hepatitis the main therapy consists of nutritionally adequate diet and bed rest. The aim is\\nto ensure recovery of damaged tissues and to prevent further damage.\\n\\nIn the early stages parenteral fluids or tube feeding may be necessary, if nausea and vomitting is\\nsevere. Interferon therapy may be useful in the beginning.\\n\\nAppetite is normally poor.  So it is crucial that meals are attractive, small and frequent – 5 to 6\\nmeals at regular intervals are suggested. It is advisable to follow the tips given below :\\n\\n• Give a full liquid diet in six small feeds, as soon as the patient is able to eat (refer to table 24.3\\n& 24.4, chapter 24).\\n\\n• Follow it by a soft fiber-restricted diet (please refer to chapter 24, table 24. 7) and then a\\nnormal diet.\\n\\n• A high calorie, high protein diet is given (refer to table 25.2), if there is extensive  weight\\nloss.\\n\\n• A low fat diet is given in the beginning and gradually move is made towards normal fat intake\\nas the biliary tract obstruction is cured.\\n\\n• Adequate  calorie supply and glycogen synthesis are ensured by giving a high carbohydrate\\ndiet.\\n\\n• Vegetables with strong flavours, spicy foods, as also rich desserts are avoided  as these may\\naffect food tolerance adversely. In this aspect the patient’s personal reactions are important.\\n\\nCirrhosis\\nMany chronic liver diseases are associated with malnutrition. One of the most common of these\\n\\nis cirrhosis. In cirrhosis the damaged liver cells are replaced by fibrous scar tissue, which disrupts the\\n\\n\\n\\n290 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nliver’s important functions. Cirrhosis occurs as a result of excessive alcohol intake (most common ),\\ncommon viral hepatitis, obstruction of the bile ducts, and exposure to certain drugs or toxic substances.\\nIt is also found in highly malnourished children.\\n\\nLiver cirrhosis is a chronic disease in which there is considerable damage to its cells, with\\ninfiltration by fats and fibrosis.\\n\\nSymptoms are similar to other liver conditions, mentioned already. These include loss of appetite,\\nnausea, vomiting and weight loss, giving an emaciated appearance. Diet alone does not contribute to\\nthe development of this disease. Well nourished people, for example, who drink large amounts of\\nalcohol, are also susceptible to it. If neglected, liver failure may follow.\\n\\nDiet: Patients with cirrhosis require a balanced diet providing 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day to\\nallow the liver cells to regenerate. Thus the diet recommended is a normal high calorie, adequate protein\\ndiet with vitamin and mineral supplements. Too much protein will result in an increased amount of\\nammonia in the blood, too little protein can reduce healing of liver.\\n\\nThere are a number of complications of cirrhosis which can be helped through a modified diet.\\nPersons with cirrhosis often experience an uncomfortable buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites),\\n\\nor a swelling of the feet, legs or back (edema). Both conditions occur due to hypertension that is\\nincreased pressure in the veins entering the liver. Since sodium (salt) encourages the body to retain\\nwater, patients with fluid retention need to reduce their sodium intake. Therefore sodium in the diet\\nneeds to be restricted to 500 – 700 mg per day. This level of sodium is achieved by ensuring that there\\nis no addition of salt to foods and avoidance of sodium rich foods such as papads, pickles, baked foods\\ncontaining baking powder or other sodium salts as leavening agents.\\n\\nPatients with damaged esophagus may need to avoid stimulants (tea, coffee), irritants (spices,\\ntobacco) and fiber.\\n\\nSmall frequent feedings of a full liquid diet, followed by a very low residue and then by a soft\\nfiber-restricted diet may help the patient to recover.\\n\\nOther liver diseases in which diet changes aid recovery include cholestasis and steatorrhoea.\\nIn this condition the bile cannot flow into the small intestine to aid in the digestion of fats. As a result,\\nfat is not absorbed.  Backup of bile in the liver is called cholestasis. In this condition fat is not absorbed\\nand is excreted in large amounts in the feces. It is noticed when feces become pale-coloured and foul-\\nsmelling. This condition is called steatorrhea. The loss of fat calories may result in weight loss too.\\n\\nTo alleviate this condition special fat substitutes need to be used, which are les dependent on bile\\nfor their intestinal absorption. These include special fat substitutes such as medium chain triglycerides\\nand safflower oil. Patients suffering from steatorrhea may also need to use water soluble form of\\nvitamins A, D, E and K, as they may have difficulty absorbing fat soluble forms of these vitamins. As\\nexcess vitamin A is toxic to the liver, such substitution needs to be carried out under the guidance of a\\nphysician.\\n\\nHepatic Failure\\nHepatic failure is also known as enlarged liver disease.\\nLiver function is severely reduced due to reduction in the number of functional liver cells. This\\n\\naffects a number of reactions such as:\\n(a) Conversion of ammonia to urea is disturbed, accumulated ammonia is toxic to the central\\n\\nnervous system.\\n(b) The breakdown of aromatic amino acids is reduced (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan)\\n\\nand these accumulate in the blood.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Diseases of Liver, Gallbladder and Pancreas 291\\n\\n(c) Branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) are broken in peripheral muscle\\nfor energy and their blood level decreases.\\n\\nThe neurological and neuromuscular abnormalities may lead to coma; if not treated, it may lead to\\ndeath.\\n\\nDiet: The main principle is to reduce protein intake to minimise ammonia production. This can be\\ndone as follows:\\n\\n(a) Protein free to low protein diet – 20 to 30g is given for a few days. As improvement\\noccurs, protein intake is increased by 5 to 10 g every few days, until the intake reaches 40\\nto 50  per day.  The protein profile can be improved by ensuring intake of branched chain\\naminoacids, orally,  enterally or parenterally.\\n\\n(b) to prevent tissue breakdown, 1500 – 2000 kcal are provided in the form of carbohydrates\\nand fat.\\n\\n(c) Patients, who are unable to take nourishment  orally, tube feeding or  parenteral nutrition is\\ngiven.\\n\\nThe bacterial growth, which results in ammonia production, is controlled by medication.\\nIn extreme conditions, when liver damage is irreparable, liver transplant is made.\\n\\nDiseases of the Gall Bladder\\n\\nBile produced in the liver is concentrated and stored in the gall bladder. Stones or inflammation of\\ngall bladder obstructs the flow of bile. Fat digestion is impaired for want of bile and there is pain in the\\nabdomen, nausea and vomitting.\\n\\nDiet Therapy:\\n(a) Obese persons are found more likely  to suffer from gall bladder disease is. Hence losing\\n\\nexcess weight and maintaining normal weight is suggested for those who are susceptible to\\nthis condition.\\n\\n(b) To ensure the contraction of the gall bladder and hence the pain, fat intake needs to be\\nreduced.\\n\\n(c) During acute attack, no food is given to rest the system. Gradually the patient is given clear\\nfluids followed by soft fiber-restricted low fat (20 – 30g) diet.\\n\\n(d) Secondary bile acids may be given to dissolve small stones present. Ultra sound shock\\nwaves are used to shatter the stones.\\n\\nAs a last resort, gall bladder maybe removed by laproscopic surgery.\\nAfter surgery, a low fat diet is given to permit healing.\\n\\nDiseases of the Pancreas\\n\\nPancreatic Insufficiency (inadequate pancreatic enzyme production)\\nPancreatic diseases include  acute and chronic pancreatitis. The symptoms are inflammation,\\n\\nedema and self digestion of the pancreas by its enzymes due to blockage.\\nThe digestion of starch, fats and protein is reduced and these are excreted resulting in malnutrition.\\n\\nAbsorption of fat soluble vitamins is also reduced. In severe cases, there is necrosis and risk to life due\\nto failure of cardiac, renal and/or respiratory systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n292 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nDiet Modifications: The main aim is to stop pancreatic secretions and let pancreas rest. Therefore\\nthe patient is given nothing orally and total parenteral nutrition is given. Hydrochloric acid production is\\ndecreased.\\n\\nWhen the patient stabilises, oral feeding with clear liquids is started, followed by soft fiber –\\nrestricted and later by high protein, high carbohydrate and moderate fat diet. It is divided into six small\\nmeals and given by using the foods allowed. Water-soluble forms of fat soluble vitamins are given as\\nsupplements. Pancreatic enzymes may also be given protein.\\n\\nCystic Fibrosis\\n\\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease in children. One in 2000 babies born alive may suffer from it.\\nIn this disease, the pancreatic and bile ducts, intestines and bronchi are obstructed by a thick secretion\\nof exocrine gland, thus preventing their normal function.\\n\\nSymptoms vary according to the systems affected and the extent to which they vary. When thick\\nmucosa in the lungs affects the bronchi, there is dryness and coughing; respiratory infections occur\\noften. When pancreas are blocked, enzymic digestion is disturbed and the undigested, foul smelling\\nfood (carbohydrate, fats) excreted in  stools frequently. Other systems  are affected as a secondary\\noutcome. These include liver, intestine, heart, kidney and reproductive system.\\n\\nDiet Therapy: A great breakthrough in treatment is the recent development of enteric, pancreatic\\nenzymes microspheres , coated with a pH sensitive substance that will not dissolve until it reaches the\\nsmall intestine.  These are taken with meals and snacks to improve digestion of food. The nutrient\\nneeds may increase in this condition. For example, energy needs may be 50 to 100 per cent and protein\\n50 per cent above the recommended dietary allowances. If tolerated, 30 or more per cent of the energy\\nneeds may be given in the form of fat. Water soluble form of vitamin supplement and mineral supplements\\nare given. Extra salt may be needed in hot weather and during heavy physical activity.\\n\\nGood diet and bed rest are the main therapy. The aim is to recoup tissues damaged due to the\\ndisease.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. List the functions of the liver.\\n2.

Its incidence has increased alarmingly and it affects 18 million Indians as reported in the\\nJournal of the Diabetic Association of India in 1999.\\n\\nStudies indicate that there may be just as many undetected diabetics and twice as many may be on\\nthe verge of getting it. Undetected and hence untreated diabetes is one of the main causes of further\\ncomplications such as loss of limbs due to impairment of nerves and loss of vision due to retinal\\ndetachment.\\n\\nDiabetes is a chronic, degenerative disease that affects the way body uses food. In normal\\ndigestion, body converts sugars, starches and other substances into glucose, which is carried by the\\nblood to every cell in the body. The glucose is used with the help of insulin (a hormone made in the\\npancreas) to produce energy for every action–pumping blood to writing to physical movements of our\\nbody.\\n\\nDiabetics are unable to produce insulin, make too little or are unable to use it.\\nDiabetes is not a disease, which can be cured. It can only be kept under control by the patient\\n\\nwith the help of the nutritionist assisted by the physician. If not kept under control, a number of\\n\\n\\n\\n294 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\ncomplications occur. These include:\\n(a) loss of sensation in peripheral nerves, resulting in injury, infection and amputation of lower\\n\\nextremities.\\n(b) Eye disorders leading to blindness\\n(c) Thickening of arteries and\\n(d) Kidney dysfunction.\\nProper care of diabetes is essential to prevent or at least reduce incidence  of complications. It\\n\\nis vital that the patient learn all about the disorder and its management, for health care in diabetes is\\nbasically self-care.\\n\\nA proper nutrition plan is the foundation of successful diabetes management. Control of diabetes\\nrests on three factors: diet, exercise and insulin.\\n\\nSymptoms and Diagnosis\\n\\nAs diabetes develops, the person complains of excessive thirst (polydipsia), increases frequency\\nand amount of urine and feels very hungry. Young patients lose weight, while older patients may be\\noverweight. The presence of sugar in the urine and above normal blood sugar level are clinical symptoms\\nof diabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 120 mg/dl or higher on two different days indicates that the\\nperson suffers from diabetes.\\n\\nClassification of Types of Diabetes Mellitus\\n\\nThere are three types of diabetes mellitus:\\nType I is Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) – About 10 to 20 per cent of known cases\\n\\nof diabetes are of Type I. There is no insulin or insufficient insulin to regulate blood glucose, because\\nthe beta cells are destroyed or are very few. The reason for the destruction of the beta cells can be an\\nauto immune reaction, viral infection, genetic aberration and/or stress.\\n\\nIt may occur at any age but a large number of patients are young. Most of the diabetic cases\\noccurring before 20 years of age are of Type I. The disorder starts abruptly with typical symptoms\\nmentioned above.\\n\\nType II is Non-Insulin-Dependent–Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM) : 80 to 90 per cent known cases\\nare of type II. In these, insulin receptor response is decreased while insulin production may be normal,\\nincreased or decreased. Sudden shock, trauma or tragic event in the family, heredity and excess body\\nweight are contributory factors. Most patients are obese. Most cases occur during the mid-thirties or\\nmid-forties. The onset is gradual and the ailment is detected during a routine medical check-up. If the\\ndiet is suitably modified and regular exercise is taken, these persons do not need insulin except during\\nstressful days.\\n\\nOther types of Diabetes Mellitus: A third type of diabetes occurs in association with certain\\nconditions. These include chronic pancreatitis or as a corollary to intake of some medications such as\\nglucocorticoids, antihypertensives, etc. In this type the plasma glucose levels are higher than normal,\\nbut lower than those indicative of diabetes.\\n\\nGestational diabetes occurs in some women during pregnancy. Diet modification as indicated\\nfor type II diabetes helps to correct the glucose intolerance during pregnancy. The blood glucose\\nreturns to normal after delivery; but many of these women develop diabetes mellitus in later years.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Diabetes Mellitus 295\\n\\nNutritional Care: is the cornerstone of diabetic therapy.\\nEnergy needs are same as for other individuals. The aim is to attain and then maintain a healthy\\n\\nweight for the body size and type. If an obese patient loses weight, it leads to improved glucose\\ntolerance. Ideally 55 – 70 per cent calories should be mainly from complex carbohydrates. The aim is\\nto control blood glucose and lipid levels.\\n\\nFibre: It is observed that substituting highly refined carbohydrates in the diet with foods, containing\\ncomplex carbohydrates and fibre, benefits both type I and type II diabetics. Such diets improve\\nglucose tolerance control, often decreases insulin requirements and tends to lower serum cholesterol\\nand triglyceride values. It also helps to control weight and lower blood pressure.\\n\\nIntake of fruits is beneficial for diabetics. The soluble fibres (pectin, gums, hemicelluloses) present\\nin fruits increase transit time, slow glucose absorption and lower serum cholesterol. Fibre content of\\ncommon foods is given in table 28.1.\\n\\nFenugreek seeds, recommended as addition to diabetic diet in ancient medical system, are valuable\\ndue to their high content of mucilaginous and total fibre. It also contains an alkaloid (trigonelline),\\nwhich is known to lower blood sugar level.\\n\\n Table 28.1 Fibre Content of Common Foods (Per Serving)\\n\\nFood Serving Size Fibre/Serving EP\\n\\nGuava, red gram tender 50g 2.6 – 3.1\\n\\nCluster beans, peas 50g 1.6 – 2.0\\n\\nFrench beans 50g 0.9 – 1.5\\n\\nGrapes, chiku, seetaphal 50g 0.9 – 1.5\\n\\nLegumes, chawli, mung, vatana 25g  0.9 – 1.1\\n\\nFruits: Banana, apples, papaya 50g 0.4 – 0.6\\n\\nWhole wheat, jowar, bajra 25g 0.3- 0.5\\n\\nCarrots, beetroot, suran, potato, onion 50g 0.2 – 0.6\\n\\nDry spices 1g 0.2 – 0.3\\n\\nLipids: In diabetic diet, the total fat should be 20 to 30 per cent of the total energy. Of these\\nsaturated fats contribute about a fourth (7-10%), monounsaturated half (10-13%) and polyunsaturated\\nabout a fourth (8-10%) of the total energy. Cholesterol content of the diet should be less than 300 mg\\nper day.\\n\\nIn a 2000 calorie diet, the calories from fat would thus be 400 to 600, which amounts to about 45\\nto 65 grammes of fat in the diet, a third of it is taken in hidden form. Hidden fat as we have seen in\\nchapter 5, occurs in foods such as milk, dahi, nuts, oilseeds, eggs and meat. Hidden fats content of\\ndiet varies, but is estimated to provide about a third or more of the total fat in the diet. Thus the visible\\nfat intake in the diet as butter, ghee and oil used in food preparation can be 30 to 40 grammes. In order\\n\\n\\n\\n296 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nto control the saturated fat intake, the amounts of animal foods such as ghee, butter, cheese, eggs and\\nmeats must be monitored to provide less than 15 grammes of the total fat intake.\\n\\nProteins: The recommended amount of protein is 0.8g/kg of ideal body weight. Adolescent\\nchildren, pregnant or nursing mothers need increased intake up to 15 to 20 per cent of total energy.\\n\\nSweeteners: Use of artificial sweeteners in reasonable amounts is acceptable to control total\\ncalorie intake.\\n\\nSodium: A moderate sodium intake of 1 gram/1,000 calories is recommended, because many\\ndiabetics are hypertensive or have hypertension. Foods containing sodium such as pickles, papads, and\\nbaked foods containing baking powder should be avoided.\\n\\nVitamins and Minerals: Requirements are similar to those of other individuals. There is no need\\nfor supplements.\\n\\nAlcohol: Alcohol is not a food and its use places an additional burden on the system. Its use is not\\nadvisable especially when oral hypoglycemic agents are to be taken as part of the therapy.\\n\\nHow do we translate the above guidelines into a diabetic diet prescription?\\n\\nSuppose the diabetic person is 50 years old, who is involved in light activity.\\nHis healthy weight is 55 kg.\\nTotal energy needed : 55 × 30 = 1,650 calories\\nProteins : 0.8/kg or 0.8 × 55 = 44.0 g, rounded to 45 g.\\n45 × 4 = 180 calories from proteins (11%).\\nFats: 28% or 16.50 × 28 = 462 calories/9 = 51g fat\\nCHO : 1650 – (180 + 462) = 1008/4 = 252g (61%)\\n\\nDiet Plan: The diabetic has to follow the diet plan through the rest of her/his life. Hence the meal\\nplan should be based on her/his normal schedule, meal pattern, food acceptance, food preparation\\nmethods and facilities available. It should also take into account the cultural – religious factors. Meal\\nplans should be realistic, attractive and flexible, within the limits of the diet prescriptions. Meals should\\nbe as similar to the family meals as possible.\\n\\nMeal Distribution: It is important to distribute the carbohydrate foods in the meals through out\\nthe day. Avoid taking too high an amount of carbohydrates at any one meal. The type I diabetics need\\nthree meals and two or three snacks each day. As these persons use insulin, the carbohydrate intake\\nshould coincide with the action time of the insulin used.\\n\\nType II diabetics or NIDDM patients, who do not need insulin, can take the three large meals at\\n7-8 am, 12-1 noon and 7-8 pm; in addition a snack at 4-5 pm and a fruit after supper may be eaten\\naround 10 pm before retiring.\\n\\nExchange Lists: The patient must study the food exchange lists available for planning diabetic\\ndiets (Table 28.2). Plan the menu by dividing the food exchanges into various meals according to the\\npatient’s need and choice. A sample menu for a 50g protein diet is given in Table 28.3.\\n\\nSample menu can be distributed according to the needs of the patient and whether the patient is\\ntype I or type II diabetic.\\n\\nIt is important to include minimum number of servings of basic food groups. Ensure that you\\ninclude whole grain cereal preparations (chapatis, bhakari/roti, whole wheat preparations, etc.), three\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Diabetes Mellitus 297\\n\\nVegetarian Non-Vegetarian\\n\\nto four servings of vegetables two of fruits (one being vitamin C rich) and four to five servings of\\nprotein foods.\\n\\nTable 28.2 Veg. and Non-veg.

It is believed that it will prevent or postpone further complications of diabetes\\nmellitus.\\n\\nInsulin: Insulin is a protein. It has to be injected to ensure its being used as a regulator in the\\nbody. If taken orally, it would be digested like any food protein and will not be able to regulate the use\\nof blood glucose. The amount of insulin needed depends on the patient’s requirements; it can be\\nreduced by exercise, while any infection or other stress may result in increased need. A number of\\ntypes of insulins are available with different duration and speed of activity. The type that helps a patient\\nto function effectively is chosen. Most diabetics, who need insulin, take one dose daily, while a few\\nmay need two doses per day.\\n\\nExercise: Exercise is an important part of any treatment plan. It should be selected to fit in with\\nthe person’s capacity and requirements. It has many beneficial effects:\\n\\nIt helps to maintain weight, heart function, control of blood lipids and reduce adverse changes\\ndue to stress.\\n\\nPersons with IDDM need to reduce their insulin dosage before and during exercise or take a\\ncarbohydrate containing snack to prevent hypoglycemia due to exercise.\\n\\nControl of Type II Diabetes\\n\\nBesides diet control, insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents may have to be taken by diabetic\\npatients to metabolize excess glucose.\\n\\nOral Hypoglycemic Agents (OHA): When NIDDM is not controlled with diet and exercise, oral\\nagents are sometimes used. These agents require the presence of endogenous insulin. Hence these are\\nnot suitable for use in IDDM.\\n\\nOHA initially stimulate beta cells to increase insulin production (which may be temporary) and\\nthus control glucose levels. These may increase the number of insulin receptor sites, thus improving\\nglucose use.\\n\\nIllness: Illness should be reported to the health care provider. Insulin or OHA should be continued\\nif these are being used. Food should be taken as usual, with change to soft or liquid diet as needed.\\nSufficient amount of fluids should be taken.\\n\\nMonitoring Control: (a) Check blood glucose to keep day-today control\\n(b) Check glycosylated hemoglobin to check long term index of control.\\n(c) Check urine glucose. Main value of this test is to confirm elevated blood glucose and monitor\\n\\nketonuria. It is not a reliable test to detect hypoglycemia or the degree of hyperglycemia.\\nSome substances give false or negative results; these are megadoses of ascorbic acid,\\nsalicylates and levadopa.\\n\\nAcute Complications\\n\\nHypoglycemia– blood glucose less than 50 mg/dl.\\nWhen a diabetic participates in games or increased activity without taking food, hypoglycemia\\n\\nmay occur.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Diabetes Mellitus 299\\n\\nWhen a diabetic takes an overdose of insulin or OHA, and does not eat at the scheduled time,\\nthere is a decreased supply of glucose, which results in fall of blood glucose level. When the blood\\nglucose level falls below 50mg/dl, hypoglycemia occurs. Hypoglycemia may also occur, when a diabetic\\nhas diarrhoea or vomits, as this results in a decrease in blood sugar level.\\n\\nHypoglycemia is accompanied by a feeling of weakness, giddiness and fainting, if not attended to\\npromptly.\\n\\nIf the person is conscious, he/she should be fed sugar, hard candy, fruit juice, sugar containing\\ncarbonated beverage or syrup, which give quick relief from symptoms. If the person is unconscious,\\nintravenous glucose should be injected immediately.\\n\\nA diabetic should carry sugar. hard candy or glucose tablets, for use when needed. A diabetic\\nshould carry a medical identity card indicating that she/he is a diabetic and should be given intravenous\\nglucose if she/he is unconscious due to hypoglycemia. Such immediate treatment can avert extended\\nhypoglycemia, which causes damage to the central nervous system and the brain.\\n\\nAcidosis and Coma: Type I diabetics are in danger of suffering from acidosis.\\nIt is caused by severe lack of insulin and stress. There is an increase in lipolysis (breakdown of\\n\\nfats for energy) and production of fatty acids. Liver oxidises fatty acids to meet energy needs. In the\\ndiabetic state, liver oxidises fatty acids and produces acetone, acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate.\\nThese tend to spill over into the urine causing ketonuria.\\n\\nPrevention is very essential and involves ensuring that carbohydrate is distributed in the daily\\nmeal to fit in with type of insulin, its dosage and time of injection.\\n\\nThus by treating early symptoms promptly, coma can be prevented.\\nIn older patients (NIDDM), the cause must be identified and treated quickly. It is very important\\n\\nto prevent dehydration.\\n\\nLong-term Complications\\nPoorly controlled diabetes increases risks of long-term diabetic complications. These health\\n\\nproblems relate mainly to tissue changes affecting blood vessels in vital organs.\\n\\nNeuropathy: These changes in the nerves involve injury and disease in the peripheral nervous\\nsystem, especially in the legs and feet. It results in sensory loss and causes numbness in feet. Inadequate\\nblood supply leaves the foot susceptible to injury, infection, gangrene and ultimately amputation. Hence\\nthe need to pursue the diet, exercise and if need be insulin, very methodically and avoid or delay\\ncomplications.\\n\\nRetinopathy: The changes in the eyes include thickening of capillaries with small hemorrhages\\nfrom broken arteries in the retina, with yellow waxy discharge or retinal detachment. This complication\\ncan eventually cause blindness. Retinopathy is not to be confused with blurry vision that occurs sometimes\\nas one of the first signs of diabetes. Blurry vision is due to the increased glucose concentration in the\\neye fluids, which brings about brief changes in the light-refracting surface of the eye.\\n\\nAtherosclerosis: Another complication is the development of fibrous plaques on the inside lining\\nof major blood vessels, which thickens gradually, narrowing the interior part of the blood vessel and\\nrestricts blood flow. This complication occurs in diabetics about four times as often as in the general\\npopulation. This risk factor accounts for the need to reduce dietary fats and cholesterol in diabetic diet.\\n\\n\\n\\n300 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nNephropathy: The thickening of capillaries in the glomerulus leads to nephropathy, later to\\nrenal failure, which is the leading cause of death among IDDM patients.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

Thus cardiovascular diseases\\ninclude ailments of heart (CHD) and of blood vessels (atherosclerosis).\\n\\nThe heart is the strongest and toughest muscle in the body. As the arteries carry blood from the\\nheart to the lungs and other tissues, any damage to the artery results in a variety of heart diseases.\\n\\nCardiovascular diseases include hypertension, ischemic heart disease, leading to angina pectoris\\nand lastly myocardial infarction. Hypertension is increased blood pressure or high BP in short. In\\nischemic heart disease, there is lack of blood to the heart muscle resulting in a heart attack. In angina\\npectoris, there is reduction of blood supply to the heart muscle due to narrowing of the artery wall.\\nMyocardial infarction is caused by thrombosis, which is coagulation of blood in blood vessel or\\norgan.\\n\\n\\n\\n302 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nCardiovascular diseases develop in three stages:\\n(a) In the first stage, arterial damage begins due to fat oxidation products, hypertension and/or\\n\\nsmoking.\\n(b) As it progresses, there is deposition of fatty material in the arterial wall, increasing its thickness,\\n\\nmaking it narrow and rigid. The movement of oxygen and nutrients is made more difficult as\\nthe arterial passage is narrowed. The heart must pump harder driving blood pressure up\\n(high B.P. or hypertension).\\n\\n(c) Lastly there is heart attack, which is also known as coronary occlusion, coronary\\nthrombosis or myocardial infarction. It is virtually like a traffic jam, causing insufficient\\nsupply of blood to the tissues of the body beyond the point of blockage. If the blockage is in\\nthe artery connecting to the brain, it leads to stroke. As blood supply is crucial to the\\nsustenance of life, it is crucial that the patient gets immediate medical aid to minimise the\\ndamage and save life.\\n\\n Ailments of the heart are on the rise and even young persons succumb to these ailments. Hence\\nit is important to understand the contributing factors, to prevent these as far as possible and arrest their\\nprogress to minimize the damage.\\n\\nRisk Factors\\n\\nThe major risk factors  are:\\n(i) elevated serum cholesterol\\n\\n(ii) emotional stress\\n(iii) hypertension\\n(iv) lack of activity leading to obesity and\\n(v) smoking\\nHeredity is an additional risk factor, for one inherits the food habits and often the life style of\\n\\none’s parents.\\nAll researchers in this field uniformly agree that high blood lipids levels are a primary cause which\\n\\ncontribute to most serious heart disorders. High sodium intake may be involved in hypertension.\\n\\nBlood Lipids\\nIn Chapter 5, you have noted that  lipids are transported in the blood stream from one part to\\n\\nanother to be utilized. Hence blood lipids are a useful measure, first for detection and later for monitoring\\nand evaluation of recovery after treatment. High levels of blood lipids (and its components, cholesterol\\nand triglycerides) is an important risk factor in the development of coronary artery (heart) disease.\\n(CAD/CHD) (Table  29.1)\\n\\nTable 29.1 Serum Lipid Levels\\n\\nSerum Level Desirable Borderline high High  risk\\nmg/dl mg/dl mg/dl\\n\\nTotal Serum cholesterol 160 190 – 239 240 and above\\nLDL cholesterol Less than 130 130 – 159 160 and above\\nHDL cholesterol More than 35 less or equal to 35\\nSerum triglycerides 30 – 190 250 – 500 500 and above\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Cardiovascular Diseases 303\\n\\nCholesterol\\nFew heart attacks occur in people who have cholesterol levels in the 160mg/dl range according to\\n\\nresearch studies conducted at Stanford and other medical centres in the world.\\nIncreased serum cholesterol level above 200mg/dl and low density lipoproteins (LDL) above 130\\n\\nmg/dl are associated with increased risk of CHD. The level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in the\\nblood is likely to be more important indicator than total serum cholesterol, as it protects the blood\\nvessel against the formation of atheroma (fatty deposit).\\n\\nIntake of high fat diet, especially saturated animal fats leads to obesity. The fat is first stored\\nprimarily in the adipose tissues and later minute amounts are deposited in the blood vesels. These fat\\ndeposits thicken the walls of blood vessels and this condition is known as atherosclerosis. Any plan to\\ncorrect the situation must include modification in the fat component of the diet.\\n\\nBasic Nutritional Plan to Monitor Serum Lipid Levels\\nThe diet changes which have proved to be effective in preventing or reversing heart disease have\\n\\nthe following nutritional goals:\\n• Reduce the total amount of fat, mainly the saturated fat in the diet.\\n• Use polyunsaturated fat in place of saturated fat in the diet\\n• Decrease the intake of the amount of dietary cholesterol\\n• Increase physical activity to alter cholesterol components in the blood.\\n• Attain ideal body weight and maintain it.\\n\\nTo accomplish these goals, the diet must have high carbohydrate (50 –70% of total calories),\\nadequate protein (12-20% of total calories) and reduced fat (20 to 30 % of total calories). The fat\\ncomponent must be such that it contains a third to half of polyunsaturated  fat, a third monounsaturated\\nfat sources and the remaining part may consist of saturated fat sources. The composition of food fats\\nis given in Table 29.2. It can help to modify one’s diet in the right direction.\\n\\nIn a 2000 calorie diet, the calories from fat would thus be 400 to 600, which amounts to about 45\\nto 65 grammes of fat in the diet, a third of it is taken in hidden form. Hidden fat as we have seen in\\nchapter 5, occurs in foods such as milk, dahi, nuts, oilseeds, eggs and meat. Hidden fats content of diet\\nvaries, but is estimated to provide about a third or more of the total fat in the diet. Thus the visible fat\\nintake in the diet as butter, ghee and oil used in food preparation  can be 30 to 40 grammes. In order to\\ncontrol the saturated fat intake, the amounts of animal foods such as ghee, butter, cheese, eggs and\\nmeats must be monitored to provide less than 15 grammes of the total fat intake.\\n\\nMeal Planning and Food Exchange Lists\\n\\nFood selection guide (table 29.3) and food exchange lists for meal planning (Appendix B ) can be\\na valuable tool in choosing foods to be used in the diet.\\n\\nCereals and Their Products: It is advisable to include whole cereal products such as chapatti,\\nbhakri, for most of the servings from this group.\\n\\nParboiled rice may be used in fermented preparations such as idli. The intake of refined cereal\\nproducts such as bread, nan, bhature etc. must be reduced.  The number of servings from this group\\nvaries from 7 – 12 and depends on the person’s total energy needs, but must provide 55 to 70 per cent\\nof the total calories.\\n\\n\\n\\n304 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nTable 29.2  Saturated and Unsaturated Fatty Acid Composition of Food Fat\\n\\nFatty Acids (%)\\n\\nFoods Unsaturated\\n\\nSaturated (%) Monounsaturated Polyunsaturated\\n(%  Oleic Acid) (% Linoleic Acid)\\n\\nA.

For sedentary\\npersons, increased physical activity will improve both physical fitness and food utilisation.\\n\\nSome clinicians prefer that the patients adhere to the dietary and life style changes, which have\\nbeen found to reduce the serum cholesterol in a number of studies. A low fat, 1600 calorie diet to\\nmaintain one’s ideal body weight  has been presented in table 29.6. The possibility exists that the\\nmedications used to alter the blood lipids may cause long-term negative effects.\\n\\nTable 29.6 A 1600 Calorie Low Fat Diet (Vegetarian)\\n\\nDiet Pattern\\n\\nCHOs Proteins Fats CHOL\\n\\nCereals 7 128 20 — —\\n\\nPulses, dals 3 42 16 — —\\n\\nMilk, toned 2.5 19 12 12 38\\n\\nEggs/Meat — — — — —\\n\\nVegetables 4 24 8 — —\\n\\nFruits 2 22 2 — —\\n\\nFat 5 — — 25 24\\n\\nSugar 4 20 — — —\\n\\nTotal 255 58 37 62\\n\\nCalories (from) 1020 + 232 +  333 =  1585\\n\\nTotal calories = 1585, Protein = 58g, Fat =37g, CHOL = 62mg\\n\\nWhen medications have to be taken to improve the serum lipid profile and reduce hypertension,\\nthese may interfere with the nutrient use in the body. It is important to discuss these aspects with your\\ndoctor and take remedial steps suggested by him/her.\\n\\nHeart and Blood Vessels Diseases\\n\\nTherapy in ailments of heart and blood vessels involves nutritional care.\\nHypertension is the most common problem in humans in India, though almost  seventy-five per\\n\\ncent of the cases are mild. If unchecked, it can be a major risk factor for other serious heart conditions.\\nNormal blood pressure is less than 140mm Hg Systolic and less than 85mm Hg diastolic.\\nHypertension has many causative factors though in 90 per cent of cases, the cause is unknown.\\nAtherosclerosis (narrowing of the arterial walls due to deposits of fatty material) causes resistance\\n\\nto blood flow, making the heart to pump harder, thus increasing the blood pressure. The increase in\\nblood pressure injures the arteries further, thus worsening the atherosclerosis.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Cardiovascular Diseases 309\\n\\nTherefore, it is essential to bring the blood pressure back to normal, to prevent the damage to the\\ncirculation system.\\n\\nDiet Therapy: Hypertension may be often due to obesity, because the increased weight means\\nincreasing work of the heart to supply blood to the extra tissue formed. For many overweight hypertensive\\npeople, dietary changes which result in weight loss will lead to reduction in blood pressure. This may\\nbe adequate therapy in mild cases. But there are normal and underweight persons who suffer from\\nhypertension.\\n\\nThe second possibility is excessive sodium intake, which draws more water into circulation, thus\\nincreasing blood volume, leading to increased blood pressure. There are about 20 per cent people who\\nare sensitive to sodium and may be affected by excess sodium intake; other 80 per cent appear to be\\nrelatively free from the adverse effects of excessive sodium intake. Research studies have shown that\\nincrease in potassium intake can lower blood pressure. Increase in intake of alcohol in excess of 2 ozs.\\ndaily has a hypertensive effect, which increases with the amount consumed.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that blood pressure control is one of the most effective ways to\\ndecrease mortality in adults.\\n\\nIn patients, whose only problem is mild hypertension ( diastolc pressure of 90-94 mm Hg),\\ntherapy without use of drugs is used to achieve control. This includes:\\n\\n(a) Moderate sodium restriction ( 1000-1500 mg/day): No salt in cooking or at the table. No\\nprocessed foods (pickles, papads, canned foods etc. containing salt). Four servings of\\nregular bread can be taken.\\n\\n(b) Adequate potassium intake: Plant foods are rich sources of potassium, especially fruits\\nand vegetables. Potassium is present in higher concentration than sodium in fruits and\\nvegetables by a factor of 5 to 50 fold. Hence intake of three to four servings of fruits, which\\nneed no preparation (hence no addition of salt), can ensure adequate potassium intake.\\n\\n(c) Regular exercise tailored to the individual is a must – walking 5 kilometres daily has been\\nfound to be an ideal way to keep fit. It needs no equipment and can be undertaken in all\\nweather.\\n\\n(d)  Stress management: is a very important aspect of therapy. It involves regular planning of\\none’s activities allowing realistic scheduling of work, relaxation, physical activity, mealtimes,\\nprayer/meditation and rest. This removes the stress from one’s days, as there is time available\\nfor each aspect of the day. Thus one does not rush from one activity to the other, gulp down\\nfood on the run or skip meals. People under stress are unable to function effectively. They\\nare worried and tense all through the day, because so many tasks are unfinished due to no\\nplanning or poor planning. A planned, enjoyable routine of each day is the most important\\npart of therapy to stress management.\\n\\n(e) Abstaining from alcohol consumption is the most desirable part of the therapy. If one cannot\\nfollow it, alcohol intake must be restricted to occasional 2 oz limit.\\n\\nSodium Restricted Diets\\n\\nMost people’s daily intake of salt is 3-7 g ( 3,000-7,000 mg). Levels of sodium restriction commonly\\nprescribed are:\\n\\n(a) 500-700 mg is severe restriction. No sodium is used in cooking or at the table. Processed\\nfoods (pickles, papads, kurdais, wafers etc.) or canned vegetables containing salt are avoided.\\n\\n\\n\\n310 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nLow sodium bread, if available, should be used. Vegetables which have naturally high sodium\\ncontent are omitted.\\n\\n(b) 1000 –1500 mg is moderate restriction. It is described above.\\n(c) 2000-3000 mg is mild restriction. Small measured amount of salt is used in cooking. A\\n\\nsmall plastic spoon (given with ice cream cups at stores) could be used to add salt in\\ncooking, instead of a teaspoon to avoid excess sodium.\\n\\nSources of Sodium in the Diet\\n\\nAll living things, plants and animals require some sodium. Hence all foods contain some sodium,\\neven before they are processed or cooked in the home. Most plant foods are low in sodium. Animal\\nfoods – meat, fish and poultry are naturally high in sodium. Eggs are especially high in sodium (most of\\nsodium is in the egg white)\\n\\nMost vegetables which are low in sodium, are permitted in the diets restricted to less than 1000mg;\\nbut not beets, spinach, chad and kale, which contain large amounts of sodium.\\n\\nFruits, unsalted butter, unsalted cereals and breads, oils, sugars can be used without restriction,\\nas these contain very little or no sodium.\\n\\nVegetables and fruits, which are low in sodium, are listed in table 29.7. This list may be useful in\\nselection of foods to be included in sodium-restricted diets.\\n\\nTable 29.7 Low Sodium Sources of Vegetables and Fruits\\n\\nSodium Content Vegetables\\n\\nLess than 5 mg/100 g EP Bitter gourd (green), bottle gourd.\\nbrinjal, french beans, onion stalks,\\nparwar, ridge gourd, onions\\n\\n5 to 11 mg/100 g EP Pumpkin, ladies finger (bhendi), peas,\\ncucumber, colocasia, potato, sweet\\npotato, tapioca (dried chips), yam,\\nbrussel sprouts\\n\\n12 – 15 mg/100 g EP Cabbage, green plantain.\\n\\nFruits\\n\\nLess than 6 mg/100 g EP Amla, guava, orange, papaya,\\npeaches, plums, chiku,\\npomegranates, tree tomato, phalsa.\\n\\n7  to 13 mg/100 g EP Pears, ripe tomato.\\n\\nSalt: Salt is the main source of sodium in the diet. It is used in cooking, baking, at the table and\\nin processing foods. Salt contains 40 per cent sodium, so a teaspoon of salt, which weighs 6 g,\\ncontains 2.4 g or 2400 mg of sodium. So if a teaspoon of salt is added to a recipe which serves six\\npersons, each person would get 400 mg in the serving.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Cardiovascular Diseases 311\\n\\nSodium compounds used in food preparations: Soda or sodium bicarbonate used in baking and\\nfood preparations (e.g., Papad) is a source of sodium in the diet. Hence the need to avoid such foods\\nin a sodium restricted diet.\\n\\nA number of drugs contain sodium e.g., Alkalizers, laxatives, sedatives and antacids.\\nThe exchange list for meal planning (Appendix B) may be modified for sodium restricted diet.\\n\\nHigh sodium foods/drugs to be avoided.\\n• Vegetables – knol-khol, amaranth, field beans and tender tur.\\n• Fruits – muskmelon (kharbooja), lichis, dried fruits and cherries.\\n• Salty snacks – potato, banana or other chips/wafers, pop-corn, salted nuts, chiwda, shev,\\n\\npharsan, bhajia, vada, chat, chana-dana, bhel etc.\\n• Papads, kurdayas, pickles, chutneys, sauces, khatta-mitha, etc.\\n• Baked foods – which contain baking powder, baking soda and/or salt such as bread, biscuits,\\n\\ncakes, pastries etc.\\n• Salted butter, cheese, khari lassi.\\n• Salted fish and meats.\\n• Sodium containing drugs such as laxatives, alkalizers, cough medicines, sedatives, antibiotics\\n\\netc.\\nDiet Plans: Food exchange list  of 1000 mg sodium diet is given in table 29.8 at two energy\\n\\nlevels.\\n\\nTable 29.8 Food  List for a 1000 mg Sodium Diet\\n\\nFood List Exchanges Exchanges\\n\\nCereals 5 7 530\\n\\nDals 3  4 120\\n\\nEggs/Mutton 3 3 75\\n\\nVegetables 3 3 135\\n\\nFruits 3 3 110\\n\\nMilk, toned 2 2  50\\n\\nFat 2 3\\n\\nSugar 2  4\\n\\n1020\\n\\nThese 1000 calorie diets might be permitted for patients after the third or fifth day after congestive\\nheart failure or myocardial infarction.

Medication is used to relax heart muscle.\\n\\nMyocardial Infarction\\n\\nAn infarct is necrosis  (dead) local area, due to lack or poor blood supply resulting in the death of\\ncells. When such an infarct forms in the heart, it is known as myocardial infarction (or heart attack).\\nIf it is in the brain it is called a stroke.\\n\\nIf the infarct (cluster of dead cells) is small, the rest of the tissue may heal, but the infarct leaves\\na scar. With therapeutic care, the rest of the organ can continue to function. But if more infarcts are\\nformed, the ability of the organ is continuously reduced, which may imperil life.\\n\\nAcute Stage: Care is highly individualized, suited to the condition of the patient. Electrocardiogram\\nis used to monitor the condition of the patient. The work of the heart muscle can be minimised by\\nletting the patient rest. Medications are given to help the heart muscle relax.\\n\\nDiet: For 24 to 48 hours the patient is only given parenteral dextrose and no food is given by\\nmouth, but sips of cool water are given. After that low fat liquid diet (500 to 800 calories  and 1000-\\n1500 ml fluid diet) is given in very small feeds for 2 to 3 days.\\n\\nThe patient progresses to a soft diet (about 1000-1200 calories), which may help establish\\ncirculation needed for digestion and absorption of food. The diet is given in five or six easily digestible\\nmeals. The fat content of the diet is less than 30 per cent of total calories, with less than.300mg\\ncholesterol and less than 10 per cent calories from saturated fat.\\n\\nThe sodium is restricted to less than 1000 mg for a congestive heart failure patient, while it may\\nbe mild for less serious condition. Gas producing foods as per patient’s perception are avoided. In\\nedema cases fluid is restricted.\\n\\nThe patient is gradually helped to progress to maintenance diet, before leaving the hospital. The\\npatient is helped to get used to a low salt diet, low cholesterol diet so that the recurrence of heart attack\\nis prevented.\\n\\nCongestive Heart Failure\\n\\nIn this condition, the heart is unable to maintain sufficient circulation to tissues. Reduced pumping\\nability leads to congestion of lungs and systemic circulation. Kidneys are unable to excrete sodium\\nnormally, resulting in accumulation of sodium in extracellular fluid and water retention. This results in\\nat first of the extremities and later the abdomen and the chest retaining water and swelling.\\n\\nThe gastrointestinal tract and hence, digestion slows down due to reduced  blood supply.

The nephron is the basic functional unit of the kidney. Each\\nkidney has about a million nephrons. Each nephron has two main parts. Bowman’s capsule (a cup-\\nshaped top of the nephron) with a network of capillaries called the glomeruli (plural of the word\\nglomerulus) in it, and the renal tubule . The tubule is a long winding tube, the first part of which\\nsurrounds the glomerulus. The fluid is driven by a pressure gradient from glomerulus into the tubule\\nand the filtration begins. As the filtrate moves along, the materials needed are returned to the blood and\\nwaste material is carried to the bladder for storage and discharge at normal intervals.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiet and Nutrition in Kidney Diseases 315\\n\\nEach nephron functions independently to produce urine. The glomerulus part of each nephron\\nfilters only a small drop of fluid a day. But the volume of plasma filtered by two million glomeruli\\namounts to a formidable 150-180 liters in 24 hours.\\n\\nThe Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is the total amount of fluid filtered each minute by all\\nthe glomeuli of both kidneys. This is normally about 125 ml. per minute and is one index of kidney\\nfunction. Most of the fluid (approx. 98.9 to 99.4 per cent) that passes through the winding tubule is\\nreabsorbed; only 1 to 2 liters of urine  gets excreted each day. This means that over 99 per cent of the\\nfiltered water, all the glucose and vitamin C, almost all amino acids, sodium and other substances are\\nreturned to the blood. But if the intake of salt exceeds the body’s needs the excess is excreted and extra\\nwater is needed to excrete it.\\n\\nFunctions of Kidneys\\n\\nThe kidneys help to regulate the internal harmony by performing the following functions:\\n1. Filtration: The kidneys are the filters through which all dissolved substances pass and\\n\\nselectively absorb those to be retained. Figure 30.1 depicts the urinary system. The end\\nproducts of protein metabolism (urea, creatinine, uric acid and urates) are removed from\\nblood by filtration to be discarded in urine. Excess of chloride, potassium, sodium and\\nhydrogen ions are also filtered out from the blood. By being selective filters, kidneys try to\\nmaintain a constant blood composition and volume.\\n\\n2. Maintenance of Fluid, Electrolyte and Acid-base Balance. Ions from the blood are secreted\\ninto the urine to maintain acid-base balance In this process they monitor the composition and\\nvolume of blood and other body fluids. Kidneys maintain fluid electrolyte and acid-base\\nbalance as they carry out selective filtration.\\n\\n3. Excretion: The kidneys excrete dissolved unwanted substances filtered out of the blood as\\nurine.\\n\\n4. The kidneys help regulate the blood pressure .\\n5. Kidneys produce erythropoietin (a hormone), which stimulates maturation of red blood\\n\\ncells in the bone marrow.\\n6. The conversion of vitamin D to its most active form calcitriol occurs in the kidneys.\\n\\nActivated vitamin D regulates the absorption of calcium and phosphorus and thus helps\\nregulate calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood.\\n\\nWhen kidney function is disturbed due to disease or trauma, all the above functions are affected\\nadversely.\\n\\nCauses of Kidney Disease\\n\\nSeveral ailments may cause kidney disorders. These include infection, degenerative changes,\\nchronic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders such as atherosclerosis, hypertension),\\nmedications, toxic metal consumption, cysts, renal stones or trauma. Surgery, burns and poisons are\\nsome traumas, which may cause kidney damage.\\n\\nObesity increases the risk of renal disease. Habitual intake of high protein diet may increase the\\nwork of kidneys and cause damage. Reducing weight, decreasing protein intake to normal level can\\ndecrease the risk of kidney disease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiet and Nutrition in Kidney Diseases 317\\n\\nChemical Damage. Environmental agents such as pesticides, solvents, etc. may cause kidney\\ndamage. Animal venom, certain plants and drugs may also damage kidney tissue.\\n\\nInfection and Obstruction. Bacterial infection in urinary tract may cause mild discomfort,\\nwhich can be alleviated by medication, if treated promptly. If not treated, it may cause more involved\\nchronic disease. Kidney stones may block drainage and may cause further infection and tissue damage.\\n\\nDiet therapy in renal disease is based on the nature of the disease and individual response.\\n\\nKidney Ailments\\n\\nAny disease that affects the function of the glomerulus or tubule disturbs the body’s ability to\\nutilise food and can cause havoc.\\n\\nGlomerulonephritis\\nNephritis is a general term used to indicate inflammation of the kidneys. When capillaries in\\n\\nglomeruli are inflamed, it is called glomerulonephritis.\\nAn acute form of glomerulonephritis often follows a streptococcal infection of the respiratory\\n\\ntract, tonsillitis, pneumonia or scarlet fever. It occurs mostly in children and young adults. If the\\ninfection is very mild, it may not be detected and treated, resulting in permanent damage to the system,\\nwhich may be detected after many years. The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, fever, rise in blood\\npressure, albumin (proteinuria) and  small amounts of blood in the urine (hemanuria) and edema.\\nUsually recovery is complete.\\n\\nDiet Therapy: When there is nausea and vomiting in the acute stage, sweetened fruit juices,\\nsweetened tea, ginger-lemon sherbet, high carbohydrate, low electrolyte supplements are given. These\\nhelp to reduce tissue breakdown. Fluid intake is monitored in proportion to the urine output.\\n\\nAs soon as the patient is able to eat, a diet to maintain weight containing sufficient calories is\\ngiven. If urine volume is decreased (as in oliguria) fluid is limited. Protein is also restricted to 40g. The\\nproteins included must be of high biological value. Sodium is limited to 1g/day. Table 30.1 presents diet\\nand a menu plan for such a patient.\\n\\nChronic Glomerulonephritis\\nIt can either be an untreated acute glomerulonephritis or an immunological cause of unknown\\n\\norigin. In the early stages, abnormal urine analysis results such as protein, red and white blood cells are\\nobserved in the urine. As the ailment advances, the patient may suffer from tiredness, edema, increase\\nin blood pressure and blurred vision. As the kidneys cannot concentrate urine, there is frequent urination\\nand need to urinate often in the night, thus disturbing sleep. If not checked by treatment, it can lead to\\nchronic renal failure.\\n\\nDiet Modification:  The diet must be planned to suit the patient’s kidney capacity.\\nNormal intake of protein is planned when kidneys are able to excrete wastes. If proteins are\\n\\nexcreted in the urine, the protein losses must be covered by appropriate increase in the diet of proteins\\nof high biological value.\\n\\nWhen the blood urea nitrogen rises with the worsening of kidney function, the protein in the diet\\nmust be reduced to 30-40 g or less. At the same time, the energy intake through carbohydrate and fat\\nmust be enough to prevent tissue breakdown.\\n\\nIf there is edema, sodium intake needs to be restricted. Due to poor reabsorption of the nutrients,\\nloss of iron can lead to anemia. Hence iron supplements are needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n318 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFood  Groups No. of Exchanges\\n\\nTable 30.1 Diet in Glomerulonephritis\\n\\nCalories – 1800,  Protein – 40 g,  Na – 800 mg\\n\\nProtein Calories Na\\n(g) (kcal) (mg)\\n\\nCereals 9 18 900 45\\nLegumes and Pulses 2 11 200 20\\nMilk, toned 2 10 200 48\\nEgg / chicken / fish ½ 3 40 10 - 65\\nVegetables A 2 — — 20\\nVegetables B 2 2 60 20\\nFruit 2 — 100 20\\nFat 2 — 180 —\\nSugar 5 — 100 —\\n\\nTotal 43 1780 183–238\\n\\nMeal Plan\\n\\nMeal Menu Items Drink\\n\\nBreakfast 1 Egg, 2 toasts, orange/mosumbi tea/coffee\\nLunch 1c rice, 1 chapati, 1s french beans, 1s dal, ½ s dahi\\nTea                               1s upma/pohe, 1 banana tea\\nSupper 1c rice, 2 phulkas, 1c dal, 1s ridge gourd bhaji, ½c dahi\\n\\nNephrotic Syndrome\\nThis includes lipoid nephrosis, a rare condition, which affects children. It may also be due to\\n\\nprogression of chronic glomerulonephritis or be related to toxins of streptococci.\\nThere is a degeneration of kidney tissue, which permits protein loss through the filtrate. Large\\n\\namounts of proteins (albumins) are thus lost through the urine from the body.\\nIn the beginning, there is swelling of eyelids and legs due to fluid retention in the body. Loss of\\n\\nalbumin in urine leads to low serum albumin values, at the same time, cholesterol level in the blood\\nincreases. In this rare disease, mortality is high.\\n\\nDiet Modifications: Diet treatments must rectify edema, excessive protein loss and malnutrition\\n(anemia, etc.)\\n\\n• Protein allowance is increased to 2-3g/kg for children and 75-100g for adults, provided\\nthrough high quality proteins (Table 30.2). High protein intake may sometimes hasten\\nworsening of renal condition. Hence some authorities recommend 1.6 to 1.8g/kg of protein\\nof high biological value. High protein supplements with low sodium content are useful.\\n\\n• Energy allowance must be adequate to permit use of protein from the diet for tissue synthesis.\\nAbout 50-60 calories/kg body weight need to be given.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiet and Nutrition in Kidney Diseases 319\\n\\nFood  Groups No. of Exchanges\\n\\n• Sodium level needs to be kept at about 500 mg to prevent edema. Low sodium sources of\\nvegetables and fruits are given in table 30.3.\\n\\n• Dietary fat and cholesterol may be limited to control hyperlipidemias.\\nThe patients may not have good appetite and may need encouragement from attending relatives\\n\\nand dietitian to consume the diet presented completely. Appetizing and acceptable preparations will help\\nthe patient to enjoy the diet planned. A diet for nephrotic syndrome is given in table 30.2 .\\n\\nTable 30.2 Diet for a Patient with Nephrotic Syndrome\\n\\nWt. of the patient – 45 kg  Calories 50 – 60/kg\\nCalories – 2400,  Protein 85 g,  Na – 500 mg/day\\n\\nProteins Calories Na\\n(g) (kcal) (mg)\\n\\nCereals 10 20 1000 50\\n Legumes and  Pulses 2 11 200 20\\nMilk, toned 4 20 400 96\\nSMP 50g 19 180 260\\nFish/chicken/duck 2 10 100 30 – 60\\nVegetables A 2 — — 20\\nVegetables B 2 4 60 10\\nFruits 2 — 100 10\\nSugar 6 — 120 —\\nOils, fats 2 — 180 —\\n\\nTotal 84 2,340 496–516\\n\\nAcute Kidney Failure\\n\\nAcute kidney failure is sudden, often reversible in a patient who had limited function earlier. When\\nkidneys are not able to carry out their normal function of maintaining the internal chemical environment\\nof the body by filtering out the wastes and excreting them, it is known as renal failure. It often develops\\ndue to gradual destruction of renal tissue by the disease or may occur suddenly as in nephrosis or\\nobstruction of the tract.\\n\\nWhen the glomerular filtration rate rapidly drops to less than 20 ml/minute, there is a fast rise in\\nthe serum urea and creatinine. When the rate drops further to 10 ml/minute or less, an excess of urea\\nand other nitrogenous wastes appear in the blood, which are symptoms of uremia. Simultaneously,\\nthere is inability to urinate, with urine output decreasing to less than 100 ml/day. At this stage, the\\npatients may suffer from drowsiness, weakness, fatigue or may have headache, itching or blurred\\nvision. Acute renal failure leads to death in one-fourth of the cases. The percentage increases to half, if\\nthe patient is over 75 years or there is associated trauma.\\n\\nDialysis has proved to be a boon for such patients. It is instituted until kidney function is regained.\\n\\n\\n\\n320 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nTable 30.3 Low Sodium sources of Vegetables and Fruits\\n\\nSodium Content Vegetables\\n\\n1.

Another approach is to give\\nglucose with essential amino acids orally, by tube feeding.\\n\\nThe fluid allowance is 500 ml to make up for insensible water losses plus the urine output. More\\nfluid is provided if there is vomiting, diarrhea, fever, etc. to prevent dehydration.\\n\\nEnergy intake should be enough to prevent catabolism. 20-40g protein is given with gradual\\nincrease to normal levels with improvement in kidney function. The serum electrolytes and urine\\noutput are constantly monitored so that appropriate diet and fluid intake adjustments can be made.\\n\\nDiet is modified as the patient regains normal kidney function, in the recovery phase of the\\nailment. A high-protein, high-calorie diet is needed by patients who have suffered tissue damage (Table\\n30.2). The recovery of kidney function may not be complete in some patients.\\n\\nChronic Renal Failure\\n\\nGradual loss of kidney function is the beginning, but if it silently continues, the glomerular filtration\\nrate begins to reduce leading to chronic renal failure. Kidneys have a vast reserve capacity, which\\nallows them to support life through much of this progressive deterioration. When the glomerular filtration\\nrate (GFR) drops from normal 125 ml/minute to less than 30 ml/minute, dietary modification is initiated\\n\\nWhen the GFR reduces to 3 ml/minute, dietary control is not sufficient and dialysis or kidney\\ntransplant is necessary to save the life of the patient.\\n\\nDietary Modifications: The diet planning takes into account the stage of the disease, its causes,\\nblood levels of urea and electrolytes, nutritional status, other diseases occurring and if the patient is on\\n\\n\\n\\nDiet and Nutrition in Kidney Diseases 321\\n\\nFood   No. of Exchanges\\n\\ndialysis. The patients awaiting dialysis have a more severely restricted diet compared to those who are\\non dialysis.\\n\\nEnergy: To prevent tissue breakdown and release of nitrogen and potassium into circulation, an\\nintake of 1900-2000 cal/day is indicated. Main sources of energy are carbohydrates and fats. Their\\nmetabolic end products do not pose a problem for the kidneys, as these are excreted through lungs\\n(CO2), sweat glands (water) and bowel (semisolid residue).\\n\\nProtein: Protein intake is reduced to reduce work of kidneys of excreting end products of\\nprotein metabolism ( namely, urea, creatinine, uric acid, sulfate and organic acids) in the urine. Most of\\nthe protein (65 to 75 per cent) in the diet should be of high biologic value (Table 30.4).\\n\\nTable 30.4 Diet for a Patient with Chronic Renal Failure\\n\\n30–40 protein, 1900 calories, 500 mg Na per day\\n\\nProteins Calories Na\\n(g) (kcal) (mg)\\n\\nCereals 8 16 800 40\\nDals & Pulses 1 6 100 10\\nMilk, toned 1 5 100 24\\nFish/chicken ½ 5 40 10–37\\nVegetables  A 2 — — 30\\nVegetables  B 3 3* 150 20\\nFruits 2 — 100 15\\nSugar 10 — 200 —\\nOils, fats 4 — 360 —\\n\\nTotal 35 1850 176\\n\\nMeal Plan**\\n\\nMeal Items Drink\\n\\nBreakfast 1 parantha / chapati-bhaji. banana Tea/coffee\\n\\nLunch 1 ½ chapati, thick dal, rice ( ½ c ), ½ c buttermilk\\n\\nTea 1 s upma, orange/musumbi Tea\\n\\nSupper Rice (2s), Phulkas (2), cabbage, bhaji, egg curry\\n\\n*   Choose low protein containing vegetables, eg.

Calcitrol may also be given as supplement as the kidney is not able to produce vitamin D\\nhormone.\\n\\nFluid is restricted when urine output is low. The total fluid intake is equal to the volume of urine\\noutput plus about 500 ml for insensible losses. The fluid intake includes water present in foods and\\nbeverages also. Thus 100 ml of milk provides 87 ml, 100 g of fruits and vegetables provide 80-90ml of\\nwater.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiet and Nutrition in Kidney Diseases 323\\n\\nDialysis\\n\\nDialysis is used in acute and chronic renal failure for a short or long periods. It does not correct\\nmetabolic problems and there is need for modification of diet as also supplements. Most patients with\\nend-stage renal disease lose whatever kidney function is left, after beginning dialysis.\\n\\nIn hemodialysis, the patient’s blood circulates outside the body through a semipermeable membrane\\nbathed in dialyzing fluid and removes nitrogenous wastes from it. Three times a week, the patient has\\nto undergo dialysis for 4 hours each time. Some serum amino acids and water soluble vitamins are lost\\nin the dialysate.\\n\\nBetween dialysis, dietary control helps to maintain acceptable levels of nitrogenous waste products,\\npotassium, sodium and fluids in the blood. Supplementation of water soluble vitamins are lost in the\\ndialysate.\\n\\nKidney Transplant\\nWhen both kidneys of a patient fail, kidney transplant provides a functioning kidney, which\\n\\npermits him/her to lead a normal life.\\nAs in any other surgery, postoperatively, dietary progression is from a liquid to solid diet, which\\n\\nis planned to individual tolerance. To help the patient to recover, a high protein, low carbohydrate and\\nsodium restricted diet follows, which counteracts the effects of drugs used in treatment. Reduced fat\\nmay also help control hyperlipidemias, while restriction of simple sugars prevents hyperglycemia.\\n\\nKidney Stones\\nKidney stones are also known as renal calculi, urolithiasis, or nephrolithias . These may be\\n\\nfound in the bladder, kidney, ureter or urethra. Deposition of varied sizes crystals in an organic matrix\\nleads to the formation of these stones.\\n\\nAs stones of varied sizes form, they normally move towards the ureter. Small smooth stones pass\\ninto the ureter, but large ones can block the ureter opening which impedes normal flow and causes\\nintense pain. The pain may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, even chills and fever. Only 10 per\\ncent stones are large and cause such reactions.\\n\\nDietary correlation to kidney stone formation is not easy to prove. They occur in conjunction\\nwith other diseases, which infect or weaken the urinary tract. Excessive excretion of calcium (e.g. in\\nosteoporosis) and concentration of urine may promote stone formation.\\n\\nLow intake of water, leading to concentration of urine may lead to the formation and deposition of\\ncrystals in the renal tract. Calcium salts (with carbonate, phosphate, ammonium), magnesium oxalate,\\nsulfate etc. account for 90 per cent of the stones; uric acid and rarely cystine or xanthine account for\\nthe rest.\\n\\nDiet Therapy: Therapy is planned on the basis of the predominant component of the stone.\\nA very liberal fluid intake of 2500 to 3000ml per day is recommended  to avoid formation of\\n\\nconcentrated urine from which salts get precipitated out as stones. This recommendation is universal\\nand does not depend on the type of stone.\\n\\nCalcium Stones: If stones are not preceded by other disease (are idiopathic) dietary calcium\\nintake is reduced to 600mg/day or less. Fiber in the diet is increased to bind excess calcium. If water\\nsupplies are high in calcium, it may be necessary to use special filter to eliminate it, before using it for\\ndrinking and cooking.\\n\\n\\n\\n324 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nOxalate Stones: A diet low in oxalate is indicated. Ascorbic acid content of the diet  should be\\nnormal. Dietary fat should be reduced to 50g/day or less if the patient suffers from steatorrhea.\\n\\nUric acid Stones: Altered purine metabolism and sometimes gout may  lead to the formation of\\nthese stones. A diet reduced in purines is prescribed sometimes.\\n\\nMost of the small stones pass through the ureter. Those which are too large and obstruct function\\nand cause pain need to be removed surgically. A modern procedure (laproscopy) in which the stone is\\nbroken into bits and flushed out, has done away with the need for painful surgery.\\n\\nDietary Modifications\\n\\nIt is important to note that dietary modifications cannot dissolve existing stones but it can be\\nhelpful in preventing development of new stones.\\n\\nSome of the steps one can take to prevent formation of kidney stones are:\\n(i) Drink lots of water. Kidneys filter harmful substances out of the blood and flush them out\\n\\nof the body via the ureters. In the presence of fluid, the waste dissolves and flows out from\\nthe body. But when the body is dehydrated, the waste products solidify in crystalline form\\nand can react with each other to form a stone of calcium oxalate or uric acid.\\nFluids are the most important input in the prevention of kidney stones. The aim is to drink\\nenough water to produce two liters of urine per day. Those living in hot climate, will need\\nadditional two to four glasses of water per day.\\nYou can check the colour of the urine, which is an indicator of its concentration. If it is dark\\nyellow, the crystals are not dissolving, and you should increase your fluid (mainly water)\\nintake.\\n\\n(ii) Increase your potassium intake. In scientific studies, it was observed that those, who ate\\na lot of fruits and vegetables rich in potassium reduced their risk of developing kidney stone\\nby 50 per cent. Bananas, citrus fruits, potatoes are good sources of potassium.\\n\\n(iii) Reduce intake of meat. The risk of kidney stones is reduced if intake of meat is reduced\\nto a serving of three ounces per day.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. List the functions of kidney.\\n2.

(1).\\nIn 2004, annual mortality due to cancer was reported to be 0.7 million. The incidence of the type of\\ncancer varies with sex and age. In Indian females, breast, cervix-uterine, oesophagel and gastrointestinal\\ncancers account for 30 per cent of all cancer deaths. In males, 31 per cent of all cancer deaths occur\\ndue to oropharyngeal, lung, oesophegal and stomach cancers. Leukemias and pediatric malignancies\\n(lymphomas and osteo-sarcomas) occur in children.\\n\\nCancer is characterized by abnormal cell growth. It can occur in any organ. In cancer, the genes\\nlose control of cell growth in some way and reproduction of cells is unstructured and excessive. The\\nabnormal growth leads to a developing mass called a  tumor  or neoplasm. Hence cancer is also called\\nneoplasia. Cancerous tumors are malignant, affecting the structure and hence the functions of organs.\\nMore than 100 types of malignant forms of cancer are known. Cancer cells are said to metastasize\\nwhen they break away from their original site, move through the blood and spread at a new site. Cancer\\ndoes not always cause death, but the mortality rate of cancer patients is high. If it is detected at an early\\nstage of development, prompt treatment can cure or eradicate it. The study of cancer is called oncology\\nand a physician, who is a specialist in cancer is called an oncologist.\\n\\nThe Causes of Cancer\\n\\nThe  exact cause of cancer is not known, but several factors are thought to contribute to its\\ndevelopment. These include: heredity, viruses, environmental carcinogens and perhaps emotional stress.\\n\\n (1)   Ambiye, R.Y. et al. Diet, Nutrition and Cancer AFST(I) Newsletter,  Bombay Chapter, p.26, Jan. 2005.\\n\\n\\n\\n326 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nSome families seem to have a genetic predisposition for cancer though it is not inherited. In such\\ncases, it is advisable to carefully avoid environmental carcinogens and be regular in medical checkups.\\n\\nEnvironmental carcinogens include some substances breathed in (tobacco smoke and asbestos),\\nradiation (from x-rays, sun or nuclear wastes), certain chemicals ingested in food and water and some\\nchemicals, which are in regular contact with the skin. Only a prolonged exposure to carcinogens leads\\nto cancer, not an occasional exposure.\\n\\nRelationships of Food and Cancer\\n\\nThere appear to be associations between food and cancer, both good and bad, though these have\\nnot been proved. About fifty per cent of cancers may be related to diet. Cancers of the colon, rectum,\\nprostrate and breast are the ones which have been shown to be associated with diet.\\n\\nHealthy immune system is maintained by adequate intake of protein foods. Any damage to immune\\nsystem, such as malnutrition, may be a contributing factor in the development of cancer.\\n\\nOn the positive side, diets high in fibre are thought to help to protect against colorectal cancer.\\nIntake of sufficient amounts of vitamin C-rich foods may protect against cancers of stomach and\\nesophagus. Intake of sufficient amounts of carotene and vitamin A rich foods may protect against\\ncancers of lung, bladder and larynx. Phytochemicals (substances that occur naturally in plant foods)\\nare thought to be anticarcinogenic agents. Flavonoids, phenols and indoles, which are abundantly\\nfound in fruits and vegetables are examples of phytochemicals. Hence it is advisable to eat six or more\\nservings of fruits and vegetables. Legumes such as lentils, mung and other dried beans and dals contain\\nproteins, minerals and fibre. High intakes of these and soya foods are associated with decreased risk of\\nbreast and colon cancer.\\n\\nHowever, excessive intake of protein and fats may be involved in colon cancer development.\\nOmega-3-fatty acids protect the cell from cancer development, whereas monounsaturated  fats\\n\\n(MUFA) are neutral. Linoleic acid, an essential fatty acid, has been shown to be a causative factor of\\ncancer. Once cancerous cells are formed it promotes their proliferation. High intake of polyunsaturated\\nfats (PUFA) in the diet have been shown to increase the development of breast, colon, pancreas and\\nprostate cancer in animals.  More research is needed to establish the role of fat and its degradation\\nproducts in the development of cancer.\\n\\nNitrites in cured and smoked foods (bacon and ham), which can be changed to nitrosamines\\n(carcinogens) during cooking, are examples of substances in foods, which are thought to be carcinogenic.\\nRegular intake of these foods is associated with cancers of breast, uterus, prostate and colon. People,\\nwho smoke and drink excessive amounts of alcohol, appear to be at greater risk of cancers of the\\nmouth, pharynx, esophagus than those who do not smoke and drink alcohol.\\n\\nWhen food is fried in the same oil continuously, the oil polymerises and these polymers have been\\nshown to be carcinogenic .\\n\\nCalcium intake up to 1200 mg/day seems to have a protective influence. So does drinking more\\nthan five glasses of water per day.\\n\\nThe most important principle is moderation. An occasional serving of bacon or buttered popcorn\\nor wine is not likely to cause cancer, but the regular excessive use of carcinogenic foods may contribute\\nto cancer. Vitamins that are thought to prevent cancer should be ingested in foods that naturally\\ncontain them.\\n\\nExcessive intake of vitamin supplements can be harmful. For example, abnormally large amounts\\nof vitamin A can cause pain, hair loss, headaches and liver and skin problems.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Cancer 327\\n\\nIn the news\\n\\nCarrots and tomatoes may reduce ovarian cancer risk: Women who eat plenty of carrots,\\ntomatoes, and other foods high in carotene and lycopene may reduce their risk of ovarian cancer.\\nThis was most apparent in post-menopausal women. Since carotene (which the body converts to\\nvitamin A) and lycopene are antioxidants, women should get their carotenoids from foods and\\nnot from supplements. They should take at least five servings of carrots and one cup of tomato\\nsauce per week.\\n\\n(Source : Reuters  Oct. 2001, Intl. J of Cancer 2001, 94:128-134)\\n\\nThe Effects of Cancer\\n\\nUnexplained weight loss is one of the first indications of cancer, because the tumor cells use the\\nnutrients the host has taken in for their own growth and development. As a result the host is famished,\\nfeels weak and may lose appetite, which compounds the weight loss.\\n\\nThe weight loss includes the loss of muscle tissue and hypoalbuminemia and anemia may\\ndevelop. In cancer patients, nutrient deficiency may affect the sense of taste and smell.  These may\\nbecome abnormal. As a result, foods taste less sweet and more bitter than they would taste to healthy\\npersons.\\n\\nDecreased digestive secretions may reduce appetite of cancer patients and they may feel full\\nwhen they eat a small amount of food. Hyperglycemia can develop due to abnormal insulin production,\\nwhich may delay stomach’s emptying and dull the apetite. Some cancers can cause hypercalcemia. If\\nthis is chronic, it can lead to formation of renal stones and damage kidney function. The location of a\\ntumor determines the effects of cancer on the host. For example, there is blockage in the gastrointestinal\\ntract causing malbsorption, when the tumor is in the esophagus or intestine. If the cancer is not treated,\\nthe continued loss of appetite (anorexia) and weight loss will create a state of severe malnutrition and\\nbody wasting (cachexia) and untimely death.\\n\\nThe Treatment of Cancer\\n\\nThree methods can be used to treat cancer. – chemotherapy, radiation, surgical removal  or a\\ncombination of these methods.\\n\\nChemotherapy  reduces the ability to regenerate the absorptive cells of the small intestine and\\ncan cause hemorrhagic colitis. Both chemotherapy and radiation may cause nausea, vomiting and\\ndiarrhea, which result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Both may also depress appetite. However, the\\npatient can get back to normal well-balanced diet after the therapy is over and these problems may\\ndisappear.\\n\\nRadiation can affect a number of body functions adversely. It can change senses of taste and\\nsmell; it can cause a decrease in salivary secretions and can reduce the absorptive tissue in the small\\nintestine. It can cause constipation or diarrhea. Decrease in salivary secretions can cause dry mouth\\n(xerostomia), difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia), tooth decay and  even loss of teeth sometimes.\\n\\nCancer surgery affects the function of the part of the body affected. The ability to chew and\\nswallow is affected in mouth surgery, the absorption is affected in gastric or intestinal surgery, resulting\\nin nutritional deficiencies.\\n\\n\\n\\n328 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nHowever, these treatments have side-effects, which have adverse effects on the nutritional status\\nof the patient.\\n\\nNutritional Care of Cancer Patient\\n\\nA cancer patient needs a high-calorie, high-protein diet, as there is an increase in metabolic rate\\ndue to cancer, need to rebuild damaged tissues and to replace nutrients lost to the cancer. Patients on\\nhigh-calorie, high-protein diet tolerate the side effects of therapy and higher doses of drugs better than\\nthose who cannot eat normally. Patients, who can maintain their weight or minimize its loss have a\\ngreater chance of responding to treatment and thus their recovery.\\n\\nThough their nutritional needs are high, anorexia is a major problem for cancer patients. It is very\\ndifficult to overcome because patients develop strong dislike to foods, which are side effects of\\nchemotherapy.  Therefore chemotherapy needs to be scheduled two to three hours before or after\\nmeals. Parenteral or enteral nutrition may be necessary in the early stages to meet the needs of the\\npatient.\\n\\nThe appetite and absorption is improved after chemotherapy. So the nutritional status of the\\npatient improves in the period between chemotherapy treatments.\\n\\nDiet plans for cancer patients require special attention. The plans need to be made in consultation\\nwith the patient, taking care to include favourite foods, prepared in familiar ways and served attractively.\\n\\nThose with a chewing problem, may find soft diet suitable. Those with diarrhea may respond to\\na low-residue diet.\\n\\nCancer causes a hypermetabolic state, which increase energy demands. Though energy needs\\nvary from one patient to another, 45-50 kcal/kg body weight may be recommended. Carbohydrates and\\nfats must provide this energy and spare protein for tissue building and immune system. Protein needs\\nvary  from 1.0 to 1.2 g/kg for those with good nutrition and 1.3 to 2.0 g/kg for malnourished patients.\\n\\nSufficient fluids need to be ingested to help the kidneys eliminate the metabolic wastes and the\\ntoxins from drugs.\\n\\nPatients may tolerate several small meals than three large ones. If possible, supplement meals\\nwith high-calorie, high-protein liquid foods as snacks.\\n\\nTo sum up, abnormal cell growth is a character of cancer. It can occur in any body tissue.\\nEnergy needs are high due to the hypermetabolic state and the demands of tumor. At the same time, the\\npatient suffers from anorexia. It causes severe wasting, anemia and several metabolic problems.\\nChemotherapy, radiation and surgery are used to treat cancer singly or in combination as needed. Due\\nto the illness and anorexia, it is difficult to improve the nutritional status of the patient. Parenteral or\\nenteral nutrition may be necessary in the early stages to start the process of recovery.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. What is cancer? What are the factors which contribute to its development?\\n2. Discuss relationships of food and cancer.\\n3. Discuss treatment of cancer including nutritional care of the cancer patient.\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 32\\n\\nNutrition in Immune System Dysfunction,\\n\\nAIDS and Allergy\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nNon-specific Immunity: Primary Defences\\n\\nSpecific Immunity\\n\\nNutritional Deficiency and Immune Function\\n\\nImmune System Disorders\\n\\nHuman Immuno-deficiency Virus\\n\\nTransmission of HIV Infection\\n\\nAdvancement of HIV to AIDS\\n\\nNutrition in HIV Infection\\n\\nAllergy: Respiratory System, Asthma, Skin, Digestive Tract\\n\\nFood Allergy Diagnosis, Treatment, Patient Education\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe ability of the body to resist infection is known as immunity. Natural immunity is the sum total\\nof the defenses of the body, which enables the body to resist infection under normal conditions. This\\nphenomenon explains why most of us resist the agents of disease that we are exposed to every day.\\nThe various types of immunity are depicted in Fig. 32.1. One can observe from the table that all types\\nof immunity are closely related.\\n\\nNon-Specific Immunity – Primary Defences\\n\\nPhysical Barriers prevent the entry and action of microbial invaders in the body. The first\\nresponse to microbial invaders is non-specific and does not need to recognise the invader.(antigen).\\nPhysical barriers are the primary defences of the body against infection. Intact skin and mucous\\nmembranes prevent entry and action of microbial invaders, As we know mucous membranes line the\\nrespiratory, alimentary and genitourinary tracts. Additional non-specific resistances include visceral\\nmovements, the complement system.\\n\\n\\n\\n330 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 32.1  Types of immunity\\n\\nCilia are hair-like structures on the lining of cells of the nose and windpipe (trachea), which help\\nto cough up the microbes, that may have entered there. Mucus produced in the nose and sinuses traps\\ndust and helps destroy bacteria. Secretions such as sweat, mucus, tears and  intestinal secretions\\nmechanically  flush away foreign substances.\\n\\nNonspecific  resistances also include  the complement system, interferon (protein formed when\\ncells are exposed to virus),  iron-binding proteins (e.g., lactoferrin and transferrin) and  phagocytes\\n(granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages).\\n\\nComplement System is a group of proteins, which interact with each other in a step-wise\\nprogression to bring about antigen-antibody reactions. If the complement system becomes defective,\\nthe susceptibility to bacterial infections is increased.\\n\\nPhagocytes ingest and destroy microorganists. Phagocytes include granulocytes and macrophages\\nall of which circulate. Macrophages mean those which eat up (kill) bacteria and viruses. Macrophages\\nready the invading agent (antigen) so that the T and B lymphocytes can recognize it and act on it.\\nPhagocytes and complement release digestive enzymes which contain lysosomes. Lysosomes destroy\\nantigen.\\n\\nSpecific Immunity\\n\\nCell-mediated and humoral are two types of specific immunity. Cell-mediated occurs inside or\\non the surface of the cell. Humoral immunity occurs in blood and fluid outside the cell.\\n\\nCell-mediated Immunity: Lyphocytes called T-cells are the main agents of cell-mediated\\nimmunity. T cells get activated on contact with antigen.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Immune System Dysfunction, AIDS and Allergy 331\\n\\nOur resistance to fungal and viral infections and regulation of humoral immunity is due to cell-\\nmediated immunity. Hence greater understanding of T-cells can help prevent and treat diseases.\\n\\nOrgan transplants, which are foreign tissues may be rejected due to the body’s T-cells recognizing\\nthese as such. Hence immunorepressive drugs are given to a patient receiving organ transplant to\\nsuppress action of their T-cells.\\n\\nHumoral Immunity  involves lymphocytes called B cells. There are a variety of B-cells. B-cells\\nspecific to the invading cell produce plasma cells, which in turn produce a variety of immunoglobulins.\\n(Ig-antibodies). These antibodies bind the antigen and form a complex. The complex cells are destroyed\\nby interaction with complement proteins. The destroyed cells are ingested by macrophages.\\n\\nMost viral and some bacterial infections occur, when there is a deficiency of B-cells.\\n\\nNutritional Deficiency and Immune Function\\n\\nThe organs which are centres of immune function, namely thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, atrophy\\nin protein-energy malnutrition. As a result T-cells numbers and phagocytosis is reduced. In the absence\\nof protective mechanisms in malnourished persons, infectious diseases are usually more virulent. For\\nexample, measles is frequently  a life-threatening disease in a malnourished child, though it is a mild\\ndisease in a healthy child.\\n\\nThose persons, who are at risk due to lack of natural immunity include :\\nInfants, the elderly,\\nfood faddists as also hospitalised patients,\\nalcoholics and drug users.\\n\\nInfants are protected by antibodies received in the womb from their mother, though immunity is\\nlow at birth. Breast milk also provides IgA (immunoglobulin A). Low birth weight infants may have\\nsuboptimal immune function and thus are prone to get infections easily.\\n\\nElderly. There is progressive decline in immune function with age. There is decrease in lean body\\nmass with age. Nutrient levels in blood fall and poor nutrition is a problem at times. Thus the malnutrition\\ncoupled with decreased immunity leads to a  greater incidence of infections, degenerative diseases and\\ncancer.\\n\\nFood Faddists. Food faddists may take deficient diets, self-treat themselves with unnecessary\\nsupplements, creating imbalance in nutrients (too much of some and too little of other nutrients). Such\\nregimen may affect immune function adversely and make them susceptible to infectious diseases.\\n\\nEffect of Specific Nutrients on Immunity.  Cell-mediated and humoral immunities are decreased\\nby any nutrient deficiency or imbalance, which reduces production or maturation of T-cells or B-cells,\\ndepresses DNA synthesis, cell division or replication.\\n\\nEnergy. In animal experiments , it is observed that animals fed diets adequate in all nutrients, but\\nwith moderate restriction in energy, live longer, have fewer tumors and exhibit slower decrease in\\nimmune function with age. Humans are likely to exhibit a similar trend. The incidence of respiratory\\ninfections is higher in obese than normal weight people.\\n\\nProtein Synthesis is an essential prerequisite of normal immune function. Cell-mediated immune\\nfunction is depressed in kwashiorkor (a protein deficiency disease).\\n\\nThe quality and quantity of protein are both important in immune response. Increased incidence\\nof infections is observed, when the diet does not meet the essential amino acid needs of the individual.\\n\\n\\n\\n332 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nImmune System Disorders\\n\\nAutoimmune Diseases: When the body’s immune defenses attack the body itself, the antibodies\\nproduced attack its cells and organs. These antibodies are responsible for autoimmune diseases, which\\ninclude insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis etc.\\n\\nSecondly the absence or insufficiency of a component/s of immune system levels leads to these\\ndisorders. Some infants have these defects from birth. Some patients may develop as part of disease in\\nan advanced stage of cancer and/or as side effects of the treatments.\\n\\nThe third type is caused by a virus (the human immuno-deficiency Virus – HIV), which destroys\\nbody’s specific cell-mediated defense system. (a helper T-cell and the T-4 cell). Hence it is called\\nacquired immuno-deficiency syndrome (AIDS). As it affects vital body systems (thymus, spleen,\\nlymph nodes, etc.) it leads to a variety of infections.\\n\\nOrdinary harmless organisms cause these infections due to the body’s loss of defense mechanism.\\nIt is important to take precautions to prevent food-borne infections as persons with AIDS are at high\\nrisk.\\n\\nHuman Immuno-deficiency Virus\\n\\nAs you may recall, a virus is a microscopic parasite that attacks and infects various tissues of our\\nbody. It gets its nourishment from our tissues and multiplies countless times causing a variety of\\nailments.\\n\\nThere are many viruses that infect humans. Some cause only mild illness, for example, those\\nwhich are responsible for causing cold. There are other viruses, which are deadly; the Human\\nImmunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is one of the deadly ones.\\n\\nOur blood contains T cells which are white cells, which protect our body from infections. HIV\\ninvades the T cells, impairing the normal function of the T cells, which is to protect the body from\\nother microorganisms present in the body. Persons, who have a healthy immune system, are thus\\nprotected from invaders by the T cells.\\n\\nHIV positive persons are those who are infected by the HIV virus. If not treated effectively in the\\nearly stages, HIV infection ultimately progresses to an Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS),\\nwhich is incurable and fatal.\\n\\nTransmission of HIV Infection\\n\\nSo far there is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be prevented. It can affect anyone of any age\\nand sex, who is exposed to it. It is not transmitted through casual contact such as shaking hands. It is\\ntransmitted through body fluids such as:\\n\\n• sexual contact\\n• by tranfusion of contaminated blood\\n• by the use of contaminated needles during ear piercing, tattooing, acupuncture, or injection\\n\\nof illegal drugs.\\n• By infected mothers to their fetuses on pregnancy or to their infants during breast feeding.\\n\\nAdvancement from HIV to AIDS: This occurs in three stages. Soon after exposure to HIV, the\\nbody produces antibodies in an attempt to destroy the virus. Some persons may have symptoms like\\nmild ‘flu, others may have no symptoms for a few months to even ten years. At this stage, the person\\nwill know that he/she is HIV-positive only if tested.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Immune System Dysfunction, AIDS and Allergy 333\\n\\nIn the first dormant stage, the virus, which is incubating, multiplies in various parts e.g. tonsils,\\nadenoid glands and spleen and destroys the T cells. If a person suspects that he/she is exposed to HIV,\\nearly detection helps to start treatment, which can prolong life, as the treatment may delay the action of\\nthe virus. Good nutrition at this stage helps to increase body’s ability to delay action of the virus.\\n\\nIn the second stage, infected persons, who are undetected and therefore not treated, suffer from\\ndamage to their immune system. Infections occur, which may result in a variety of symptoms such as\\nfatigue, headache, oral infections, cough, sore throat, fevers, shortness of breath, diarrhea, weight\\nloss, skin rashes, night sweat, etc.\\n\\nIn the third stage, HIV infection leads to AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). It is\\nevident from a very low T-cell count, which results in the body’s inability to fight infections. At this\\nstage, other parasites invade (e,g, T.B.) and in the absence of immunity, the body succumbs.\\n\\nNutrition in HIV Infection\\n\\nA healthful, nutritious diet ensures a healthy immune system, which may delay the progression of\\nHIV infection to AIDS.\\n\\nWhen a person is diagnosed as HIV positive, it is important to assess the nutritional status of the\\nperson. At this early stage, any unhealthful dietary habits can be corrected with a dietitian’s guidance\\nand the importance of meeting future nutritional needs emphasised to help the action of the body to\\nresist the action of the virus.\\n\\nAs the condition progresses, patients may begin to suffer some of the problems listed above. The\\nmetabolic rate, nutrient and energy needs increase due to infections, while the appetite and ability to\\nabsorb nutrients may decrease. Medicines given may cause nausea and reduce the appetite. Taste may\\nchange, swallowing may be painful due to oral infection. These difficulties may result in malnutrition,\\nsuch as protein-energy malnutrition and hence loss of weight.\\n\\nTo improve the appetite of the patient, there are several things the dietitian can do, such as:\\nOffer soft food,\\nServe frequent small meals,\\nOffer food the patient tolerates,\\nAdd sugar and flavourings to improve acceptability of  liquid.supplements,\\nAvoid extremely hot or cold foods, spicy or acidic foods,\\nGive medicines after meals,\\nTalk to the patient to help him/her unburden worries about family, friends and finances.\\n\\nAllergy\\n\\nAllergy is hypersensitivity to certain substances or conditions. The allergic person may have\\ndistressing symptoms from what she/he breathes, eats or touches. To the allergic person a summer\\nday with its pollen grains means hay fever or asthma.  A person allergic to a particular food may have\\nstomach pains, eczema or skin rashes and/or migraine headaches, if she/he eats it. A person allergic to\\na particular dye may develop an intense itching, rash on even a slight contact with the dyed cloth.\\n\\nAbout 10 to 20 per cent of the population suffer from allergy. The allergic person produces\\nantibodies, which combine with foreign material such as pollen or food protein leading to an antigen-\\nantibody reaction with release of mediators such as histamine and prostoglandins. These mediators\\ninjure the body cells and cause illnesses. Such illnesses are called  allergies.\\n\\n\\n\\n334 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nRespiratory System: The linings of the nose, the windpipe and the bronchial tubes are  affected\\nby a variety of substances such as pollens of ragweed and grass, mold spores, house dust, dust from\\nfeathers, animal hair, mites from pillows, bed linen etc.. These result in allergies of the respiratory\\nsystem.\\n\\nAsthma: The lining of the nose continues into the bronchial tubes. Asthma in most cases is an\\nextension of nasal allergy into bronchial tubes. About 40 per cent patients who have nasal allergy\\ndevelop asthma . As the substances that cause swelling and cause increased secretions affect bronchial\\ntubes, the passage becomes narrower, gets plugged with thick mucus. These cause difficulty in breathing\\nand induce coughing attacks, the main symptoms of asthma ( meaning ‘breathless’).\\n\\nSkin: Two types of allergies affect skin – eczema and hives. Some materials, which  affect\\nalmost everyone are poison ivy and poison oak or sumac. These materials can produce severe blistering\\nrashes due to allergy in any person following sufficient exposure.\\n\\nMany other substances also affect skin and produce less severe rashes, which may cause itching\\nand redness in the affected areas. These include dyes (used to dye hair or clothes), chemicals in\\ncreams, shampoos and cosmetics, furniture polishes, detergents, mercury and nickel compounds and\\nmany others.\\n\\nAllergic eczema may be caused by substances taken  internally. In mild attacks, the face, neck,\\nback of elbows/knees are involved; in severe cases, rash may cover the entire skin.\\n\\nHives (urticaria) are temporary swellings starting below the skin surface. The most common\\ncauses of hives are foods and drugs.\\n\\nThe Digestive Tract: Foods are the most common cause of allergic symptoms in the gullet,\\nstomach or intestines; while some drugs may also cause allergy. The symptoms may appear within few\\nseconds to several hours after the intake of food. The symptoms of gastrointestinal allergy vary from\\nmild discomfort (bloating and constipation or diarrhea) to severe abdominal pains. The gastrointestinal\\nsymptoms may begin in the area first exposed like the mouth, gums, lips, tongue and pharynx, which\\nmay itch, swell and burn.\\n\\nFood Allergy Diagnosis\\n\\nMany steps are involved in assessment and diagnosis of a food allergy.\\nAssessment: In the diet history, symptoms and their timing, suspected foods and the amounts\\n\\neaten to produce a reaction as also family history of allergies is recorded. The cause may be a common\\nfood or foods or a non-food. Anthropometric  measurements are recorded to evaluate growth and\\ndevelopment in the child. Nutritional assessment can help to detect persons at risk of malnutrition.\\n\\nDiary of Food Intake and Symptoms is kept for 2 weeks. It helps to identify food causing\\nallergy and also gives an idea of  nutritional adequacy of the diet.\\n\\nTreatment\\nTo treat any allergy requires finding causes as indicated above. A very careful diet study is\\n\\nnecessary with tests in which suspected foods are eliminated or purposely tried to observe their effect.\\nIntelligent observation is essential, in which the patient’s patience and physician’s skill play important\\nroles. The only effective treatment is to avoid the substances causing the allergy.\\n\\nFor infants, who are not breast-fed and are allergic to cow’s milk, casein hydrolysate formulas\\nare used.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Immune System Dysfunction, AIDS and Allergy 335\\n\\nPersons, who have allergy to foods, should be educated about cross-reactivity, that is allergy to\\nthe foods from the same group or botanical family. Thus a person who is allergic to groundnuts may\\nalso be allergic to other beans such as soybeans.\\n\\nPatient education: Patient’s meal pattern must fit in with their family pattern. Nutritional adequacy\\nmust be achieved. If one is allergic to citrus fruits, other sources of ascorbic acid must be included in\\nthe diet.\\n\\nPatients need to be educated to read food labels and avoid those containing foods,  which they are\\nallergic to.\\n\\nWhile eating out it is best to select foods, which are free from the offending food. While minute\\namounts may produce adverse reactions, the person, should wear a medical alert locket indicating the\\nallergen(s) and carry an epinephrine kit to be used if the offending food is eaten by mistake or\\nunknowingly. The injection of epinephrine can give great relief from an allergic reaction.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. What is non-specific immunity?\\n2.

About 250 of these have a defined\\nbiochemical basis. These disorders result from variation in the structure of enzymes or protein molecules.\\nThe amino acid sequences of enzymes, which are proteins, and their quantity are decided by genes.\\nAbout 30% of our population is heterozygous for common alleles, as suggested by the extent of normal\\nvariation in genes. Relatively rare traits, which result in disease, are produced by mutations of genes.\\nThe frequency of occurrence of mutant genes varies in populations. For example, maple syrup urine\\ndisease (MSUD) occurs in about one in 250,000 newborns worldwide, but in an inbred Mennonite\\npopulation, it occurs one in 176.\\n\\nGenetic disorders can affect the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, pyrimidines, minerals\\nand vitamins, depending on the metabolic pathway that is affected.\\n\\nTo prevent irreversible changes, such as brain damage, in infants, population-wide nonselective\\nscreening of newborns has been instituted for PKU, MSUD, galactosemia, homocystinuria and\\ntyrosinemia in UK and USA. In these disorders, speed in diagnosis and treatment is of the utmost\\nimportance.\\n\\nMetabolic Disorders Benefited by Nutrition Support\\n\\nIn metabolic disorders  accumulation, excess production or lack of  normal substrates and\\nmetabolic  products, leads to toxic symptoms. In many of these, appropriate changes in the dietary\\nsupply helps to alleviate the problem.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition Support in Metabolic Disorders 337\\n\\nIdentifying the affected persons before irreversible changes have occurred is a very important\\nstep in optimum management of these disorders. Analysis of the amniotic fluid cells in the sixteenth to\\neighteenth weeks of gestation can help to detect a number of genetic disorders. Such search for\\ngenetic disease is done when there is a family history of inherited disease. Such tests help to prevent\\ninborn error such as congenital cataracts in galactosemia by removing lactose from mother’s diet.\\nOther metabolic disorders can be detected by analysis of blood, urine, etc. of susceptible infants.\\n\\nIt must be noted that persons suffering from metabolic disorders benefit from nutrition support,\\nwhen it is given promptly after detection. In this chapter, only a few disorders will be discussed to\\nillustrte that early nutrition support can prevent irreversible, severe pathogenic problem.\\n\\nEight approaches to therapy of metabolic disorders are discussed here. Selection of the method\\ndepends on how the disease occurs. Several methods may be used in sequence or at the same time,\\ndepending on the case.\\n\\n1. Correct the basic imbalance in metabolic reactions.\\nFor  example, in phenylketonuria (PKU) , which occurs due to phenylalanine hydroxylase\\ndeficiency, intake of phenylalanine is limited and tyrosine is supplemented.\\n\\n2. The excretion of accumulated metabolic products, which are overproduced, is enhanced.\\nIn gout, the blood uric acid levels are lowered by blocking renal reabsorption with use of\\ndrugs. Then the tissue deposits of uric acid are mobilised for use.\\n\\n3. Alternate metabolic pathways are provided to reduce accumulation of toxic precursors in\\nblocked reaction.  For example, in urea cycle defects, the accumulated ammonia is decreased\\nby using nitrogen to form phenylacetyl glutamine from glutamine by giving curative amounts\\nof phenylacetic acid.\\n\\n4. To reduce overproduction of reaction products by use of inhibitors. Thus in gout,\\noverproduction of uric acid is inhibited by use of allopurinol.\\n\\n5. Products of blocked pathways are provided. Administration of pancreatic enzymes, when\\nthe normal secretion is blocked, helps to correct the digestive defect in cystic fibrosis.\\n\\n6. Altered enzyme proteins are stabilised. Appropriate intake of the co-factor vitamin B6 in\\nhomocystinuria or thaimine in MSUD increases intracellular coenzymes of these vitamins\\nand hence the specific activity of the related enzymes.\\n\\n7. Deficient cofactors are replaced. Appropriate intake of specific vitamin precursor cures a\\nnumber of vitamin dependent disorders, which occur due to blocks in production of their\\ncoenzyme.\\n\\n8. Genetic counseling to limit the frequency of inherited diseases. Genetic counseling  can\\nprevent marriages between high-risk individuals and thus reduce the birth of affected progeny.\\n\\nThe main component of treating inherited disorders is nutrition management. In addition to dietary\\nrestrictions, some amount of chemically  tailored foods need to be used to correct imbalances in\\nmetabolic relationships.\\n\\nMetabolic Disorders Involving Amino Acids\\n\\nAmino acids are the building blocks of proteins. They have many functions in the body. Metabolic\\ndisorders related to amino acids can occur due to defects in the way they are metabolised or their entry\\ninto the cells. As these disorders lead to symptoms early in life, newborns are screened for them\\nroutinely in some countries.\\n\\n\\n\\n338 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nPhenyl ketonuria (PKU) was discovered in 1933. Prevention of mental retardation caused by it,\\nis a classic example of diet therapy.\\n\\nOf the amino acid disorders, phenyl ketonuria (PKU)  will be discussed, as it is one of the few\\ncauses of mental handicap for which reasonably effective treatment is available.\\n\\nIn classic PKU, the activity of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase is less than 1 per cent of\\nnormal. This enzyme is present in the liver and converts excess phenylalanine to tyrosine, another\\namino acid which is eliminated from the body. In 1 to 3 per cent cases with defective hydroxylation,\\nthere is deficiency of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin, and in this rare condition, the brain damage is\\nnot prevented by dietary treatment.\\n\\nPhenylalanine is an essential amino acid, which needs to be provided through food, as it cannot be\\nsynthesized in the human body.\\n\\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a group of inherited disorders of phenylalanine metabolism. It is caused\\nby impaired phenylalanine activity. The symptoms occur at 3 to 6 months of age. These include\\ndevelopmental delay, microcephaly, abnormal electroencephalogram, eczema, musty odour and\\nhyperactivity.\\n\\nIn some countries (UK, USA) neonates are screened between 6th  to 14th day after birth for PKU.\\nIf diagnosed for PKU, treatment must be started immediately, to minimise the deleterious effects of the\\ndisease.\\n\\nTreatment involves intake of controlled low-phenylalanine diet and regular monitoring of the\\nblood phenylalanine concentrations. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid. If the amount in the diet\\nis insufficient, brain damage will occur. Hence the essential requirement must be ingested each day, a\\npart of the daily requirement being given with each meal. The synthetic protein substitute for PKU must\\ncontain all the other essential amino acids needed. In addition, tyrosine becomes essential due to the\\nmetabolic block. The recommended intake of all other nutrients is similar to that of other infants.\\n\\nThe practical management of the PKU diet is very important. The levels of phenylalanine in the\\nblood should be monitored on specimens taken 3.5 to 4 hours after a feed or main meal, using a\\nmicromethod (Guthrie), so that a capillary sample can be used. The suggested frequency of checking\\nis weekly during the first few months for infants, every two weeks after weaning to toddler age; every\\n3 – 4 weeks in preschool age and 4 weekly thereafter up to teens; after that, it may be every 2 – 3\\nmonths or less. Young children are likely sometimes to pilfer food or suffer from infections. At such\\ntimes the blood levels of phenylalanine needs to be checked and monitored.\\n\\nDuring infection, when a child is likely to eat poorly, a high-energy drink must be fed to avoid\\nbreakdown of tissues, which may elevate phenylalanine level.\\n\\nHuman milk has lower phenylalanine content than cow’s milk. Hence time-controlled breast-\\nfeeding can be judiciously combined with use of protein substitute for a newly diagnosed infant.\\n\\nThe sweetener, aspartame (nutrasweet/other brand name) contains phenylalanine and should not\\nbe fed to phenylketonuric patients of any age. Manufactured foods containing these sweeteners also\\nneed to be avoided from the  PKU diet.\\n\\nA lady suffering from PKU, who wishes to have a child, must be advised to stick to low –\\nphenylalanine diet, much before conception and continue it through pregnancy. The blood levels must\\nbe strictly controlled. Strict monitoring of the diet is essential to ensure adequate supply of energy,\\nphenylalanine and tyrosine and other nutrients to ensure appropriate growth of the fetus.\\n\\nWhen a mother with phenylketonuria, takes normal diet during pregnancy, her child has a high\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition Support in Metabolic Disorders 339\\n\\nprobability of suffering from severe congenital abnormalities such as mental retardation, microcephaly\\nand heart defects.\\n\\nMaple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD) is a group of  inherited disorders of the metabolism of the\\nbranched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine. Impairment of the branched-chain alpha-\\nketo acid dehydragenase occurs due to several different mutations.\\n\\nAt birth infants with MSUD appear normal and well. But after intake of a protein-containing feed,\\nin severe cases seizures, aponea (suspension of breathing), occurs. If not treated death occurs within\\nten days of birth.\\n\\nHence it is urgent to screen susceptible newborns for MSUD, diagnose it and start appropriate\\nfeeding promptly within the first week of life. This may consist of orogastric feeding of branched-\\nchain aminoacid-free protein and energy source, which should be started as soon as possible after\\ndiagnosis is made. The aim is to initiate anobolism in the infant and prevent accumulation of neurotoxic\\nbranched-chain aminoacids.\\n\\nFor patients with 15% or more enzyme activity, protein intake of upto 1.5 g/kg/day may be\\nsufficient.\\n\\nThe long-term diet therapy for MSUD involves maintenance of plasma concentrations of the\\nbranched-chain amino acids within specified limits, to permit maximum intellectual development and\\nprovide all other nutrients for optimal growth.\\n\\nThe nutrition support is achieved by use of special medical foods and natural foods.\\n\\nGalactosemia\\n\\nLactose is the principal carbohydrate and energy source for infants and young children. Galactose\\nis found only as a component of lactose in natural foods and has a central metabolic role in human\\nnutrition.\\n\\nGalactose is formed by hydrolysis of lactose by lactase in the intestine.\\nGalactose must be converted in the liver to glucose before it is used; this occurs through three\\n\\nenzymatic steps. (Fig. 33.1).\\nGalactosemia may occur due to deficient function of any of three enzymes (galactokinase, galactose-\\n\\n1-phosphate uridyl transferase or UDP  galacto-4-epimerase)\\nDeficiency of galactokinase results in only cataracts.\\nGalactosemia due to deficiency of galactose-1-P-transferase leads to accumulation of galactose-\\n\\n1-P with progressive damage to the central nervous system, liver and renal tubule, if galactose restriction\\nis not started in the first few days of life. In most of the untreated infants, who survive, retarded mental\\nand physical growth occurs.\\n\\nDiagnosis of galctosemia is made by measuring galactose-1-P transferase activity in erythrocytes.\\nRecently a rapid ancillary method has been developed for prenatal diagnosis of galactosemia. In this\\nmethod, the amniotic fluid of a fetus is analysed for elevated level of galactitol by GC/MS, which\\nindicates impaired transferase activity.\\n\\nNutrition support aims to prevent or improve symptoms and at the same time provide adequate\\nenergy and other nutrients to ensure normal growth and development of the infant. Treatment consists\\nof the removal of all sources of lactose and galactose from the diet. It should be started from the first\\nweek of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n340 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nFigure 33.1 Metabolic blocks in galactose metabolism that lead to galactosemia. Genetic disorders of\\ncatalyssed reactions are indicated by hatched bars\\n\\nHuman milk contains 6 to 8 per cent lactose, cow’s milk 4 to 5 per cent lactose and infant\\nformulas 7 per cent lactose. These milks must be replaced by a formula low in galactose. Soya protein\\nisolate formulas have been found to be suitable, as it contains only 1.4 mg galactose per 100ml. in\\noligosaccharide forms which are not hydrolysed in the human intestine.\\n\\nAs the child grows, solid foods are added to the diet, after proper scrutiny to avoid lactose\\ncontaining foods. Even fermented dairy products and aged cheeses must be excluded from the diet, as\\nthe conversion of lactose to lactic acid is not complete in these.\\n\\nFoods allowed - in galactose restricted diets are – cooked rice, chapaties, millet breads made\\nwithout milk addition, home-made cakes, puddings, pasta, all dals, legumes, nuts and seeds.\\n\\nFats – Oils, nuts, shortenings.\\nSugar Beverages – carbonated drinks, fruit juices other than apple, grape, pear and papaya.\\nMeat, fish, poultry – all primary products, not prepared ones, which contain milk or milk\\n\\nproducts.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Cardiovascular Diseases 341\\n\\nSoups – clear soups, dal soups, vegetable soups made with vegetables allowed.\\nVegetables – asparagus, beets, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, corn, cucumbers, brinjal, lettuce,\\n\\nladies’ finger, potatoes, spinach and yams.\\nMiscellaneous foods – Popcorn, pure sugar candy, jelly or marmalade, sugar, corn syrup, pickles,\\n\\npure spices and seasoning, molasses, honey.\\nFoods excluded -  All milk and milk products, all cheeses, commercial cakes, biscuits, custard,\\n\\npuddings, ice cream, Omelets and souffles containing milk,\\nButter, cream, cream cheese, salad dressings containing lactose, non-dairy cream sweeteners\\n\\ncontaining sodium/calcium caseinate, diet through life All canned or frozen fruits containing lactose,\\nApples, bananas, dates, figs, grapes, kiwi fruit, papaya, pears, persimmon, water melon, All\\n\\nlegumes, fermented  soyabean  products; hazelnuts, safflower seed kernel,\\nVegetables – bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, onions, peas, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, tomatoes,\\nMiscellaneous – chewing gum, milk chocolates, some cocoas, toffee, peppermint, caramels,\\n\\ncertain drugs and vitamins and mineral preparations,\\nSpice blends with added lactose, artificial sweeteners containing lactose.\\nGalactosemic patients need to follow galactose-restricted diet to avoid damaging effects of\\n\\naccumulated galactitol in lens, liver and kidneys.\\n\\nEndocrine Disorders\\n\\nHypothyroidism:  Hypo, that is decreased secretion of thyroid hormones (thyroxine) by the\\nthyroid gland, leads to lowering of metabolic rate. Mild form of this disorder is common and affects\\nwomen more often than men. Overweight is common due to lower metabolic rate. Screening of\\nnewborns helps to detect it and start treatment early.\\n\\nSevere hypothyroidism in adults is known as myxoederma. In this condition, the metabolic rate is\\nvery much reduced. It results in weight gain, flabby muscles, lethargy,  constipation and high blood\\nlipids. Severe lowering of metabolic rate in fetal life is  known as cretinism and is discussed in Chapter\\n13.\\n\\nTreatment: A synthetic hormone is given to make up for the missing thyroid hormone. Dietary\\nfiber is increased to prevent constipation. A calorie restricted diet helps to maintain normal weight in\\noverweight patients.\\n\\nHyperthyroidism: The metabolic rate is increased by 50 per cent due to excessive secretion of\\nthe thyroid gland. As a result of increased metabolic rate, the appetite is increased resulting in hyperactivity,\\nnervousness, rapid heartbeat and loss of weight. The thyroid gland is enlarged; the eyes are prominent\\nand there is double vision. Liver glycogen is rapidly lost due to increased metabolism and there is tissue\\nwasting. Increased excretion of calcium and phosphorus may cause osteoporosis\\n\\nTreatment: A high calorie (4000 – 5000 kcal) and high protein (100 – 125 g) diet is required to\\nreverse the weight loss and tissue wastage until normal nutritional status is attained.\\n\\nIntake of snacks between meals helps to increase calorie intake and satisfy hunger. Multivitamin\\nmineral supplements are often given. Foods containing caffeine are avoided due to their stimulating\\neffect.\\n\\nTo reduce the metabolic rate to normal, antithyroid drugs are used in most cases. Tranquilisers\\nare given to control cardiac and hyperactivity effects.\\n\\n\\n\\n342 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1.

Stress disturbs the normal steady state (homeostasis)\\nof the body. The extent of alteration in nutritional needs depends on the kind and extent of stress\\nimposed on the body.\\n\\nEmotional and mental stress is caused by anxiety, worries and tension due to a variety of\\nsituations real and sometimes imaginary. The ability of individuals to handle stress varies.\\n\\nEmotional stress is one of the factors, which is found to cause some serious conditions such as\\npeptic ulcer, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and even cancer. Some of the common emotional\\nstress situations include sudden death of a near relative (child, mate, parent), losing a job, divorce,\\nfinancial problems, loss of limb in accident and even inability to cope with change such as job, location,\\nnew family member etc.\\n\\nPhysical stress includes burns or thermal injury and surgery.\\n\\nNutritional Requirements During Stress\\n\\nThese are affected by three main factors:\\n(a)   the kind of stress – its severity, extent and period.\\n\\n\\n\\n344 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\n(b)  nutritional status of the patient\\n(c)  age of the patient.\\nFood intake is often reduced due to stress; the body reserves are of great importance. Thus a\\n\\nperson in optimal nutrition state before stress can face the stress situation better as he/she can call on\\nthe body reserves.\\n\\nBurns\\n\\nBurns are one of the leading cause of accidental death in India. Burns or thermal injury impose an\\nunparalleled stress on the human body. The percentage of body surface area involved, the extent of\\ncellular damage and the area of the body affected would determine the severity of the burns.\\n\\nBurns are usually classified as follows:\\nFirst Degree: If only the epidermis is affected, it is a first degree burn. It is important to provide\\n\\noral fluids to replace losses due to oozing and give medication for pain relief.\\nSecond Degree: Second degree burns are very painful as both epidermis and dermis are injured,\\n\\nresulting in exposure of nerve endings. It is important to maintain aseptic and hygienic condition of the\\naffected part to avoid infection. The dietary treatment consists of ample fluids and provision of adequate\\nnutrients in the diet to ensure quick healing.\\n\\nThird Degree: In third degree burns, both epidermis and dermis are destroyed, nerve fibers are\\nalso destroyed, resulting in lack of sensation and pain. When the layer of dead skin begins to separate,\\npain is felt. If the burns involve more than ten per cent of the body surface, nutrition support is\\nessential to expedite recovery. This includes generous intake of fluids and adequate nutrient intake\\nthrough a well  planned diet.\\n\\nFourth Degree: In fourth degree burns, the subcutaneous tissue,  muscle and bone are damaged.\\nThere is need for constant, well  planned nutrition support to help recovery.\\n\\nBurns interfere with normal functions of the skin; these include protection against infection,\\ncontrol of body temperature, fluid balance, sense of touch and the beauty of looks.\\n\\nDiet: In the first few days after burn injury, it is very difficult to provide sufficient energy and\\nproteins because of the hypermetabolic state of the body. When the stress response becomes moderate,\\nit is easier to meet the needs for these nutrients.\\n\\nThe ascorbic acid intake is increased up to 1 g per day and a zinc supplement is often given to\\nhelp wound healing process. Passive exercise helps to reduce protein loss. Use of layered dressings\\nhelp to maintain body temperature and thus reduce protein losses. However, the nutrients and electrolytes\\nlost through  exudate or fluid leaking out of capillaries and urine needs to be replaced.\\n\\nMode of Feeding: Initially parenteral nutrition is required, if peristalsis is absent due to shock.\\nWhen gastrointestinal function has returned, there is a transition made to oral feeding or tube feeding,\\non the basis of the nature and site of burns. Special formulas are used for hypermetabolic states;\\nprotein supplements or modular feedings can be utilized.\\n\\nNutritional Assessment: As nutritional care plays a major part in recovery from burns, nutritional\\nassessment from time to time is essential to monitor the patient’s progress. The techniques used will be\\ndecided by the state of the patient.\\n\\nComplications:  One of the complications which occur are stress ulcers. Prevention of stress\\nulcers involves several steps, which include – fluid replacement to prevent hypovolemia, oxygen therapy\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Stress, Burns and Surgery 345\\n\\nto prevent hypoxia of gastric mucosa, nutrition support to nourish gastric mucosa and use of antacids\\nto maintain gastric pH above 5.\\n\\nNutritional Care of Patient with Burns\\n\\nDays 1-3 (Immediate shock period)\\nLoss of enveloping skin surface and exposure of extracellular fluids leads to immediate loss of\\n\\ninterstitial water and electrolytes, mainly sodium and large protein depletion.\\nFluid therapy:\\n(i) Colloid (protein) through blood and plasma transfusion\\n(ii) Electrolytes, sodium and chlorine by use of saline solutions – lactated Ringer’s solution\\n(iii) Water {dextrose solution) to cover additional insensible losses\\nRecovery period (days 3 to 5): Intravenous therapy is discontinued and oral  solutions such as\\n\\nHoldene’s is used\\nHoldene’s solution (oral fluid and electrolyte replacement)\\n3 – 4 g (1/2 tsp) salt\\n1.5 – 2 g (1 ½ tsp) baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)\\n1,000 ml water\\n+ lemon juice for flavour and chill\\nA careful check of fluid intake and output is essential with constant check of dehydration over\\n\\nhydration.\\nSecondary Feeding Period (6–15 days): Optimal nutritional therapy necessary to\\n(a) make up for tissue destruction in which protein and electrolytes are lost\\n(b) due to continued nitrogen losses due to tissue catabolism\\n(c) due to increased metabolic demands of infection (extra calories + B vit.), fever and tissue\\n\\nregeneration (protein + vit.C)\\n(d) to have optimal tissue health necessary for subsequent grafting to be  successful.\\n\\nPrinciples of Diet Therapy\\n\\nA high protein, high calorie and high vitamins diet is needed to ensure rebuilding of tissues\\ndamaged/destroyed and catabolised.  The protein requirement varies from 150 – 400 g/day.\\nSimultaneously the calorie need  varies from 3,500 – 5,000cal/day. Intake of high carbohydrate foods\\nis suggested. The need for vitamins is very high to ensure recovery. The recommended vitamin C\\nintake is 1 – 2 g. per day. There is a need for  increased intake of  thiamine,  riboflavin and  niacin to\\nmetabolize the extra carbohydrates and protein in the diet.\\n\\nIntake record – A careful record of protein and calories in the amount of food consumed is a\\nnecessary tool for planning care.\\n\\n\\n\\n346 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nA diet plan to be followed in recovery period is given below.\\n\\nDiet Plan\\n\\nBreakfast Lunch and Dinner\\nEgg Chapati  2\\nBread + Butter Dal\\nBananas Rice\\nMilk Dahi\\nIn between Vegetables\\nButtermilk, custard,\\nDahi + roasted methi powder\\nMilk + milk powder + flavour\\n\\nAccidental Injury\\n\\nA number of accidental injuries lead to physical stress.

If there are fractures, in addition, the healing is more complicated.\\n\\nThere is a loss of protein rich fluids from open wounds, which needs to be replaced. Healing of\\nfractures may involve bed rest, which increases loss of calcium due to lack of movement.\\n\\nNutritional Care: The losses in injury have to be replaced and needs of healing have to be met.\\nIn the first 24-48 hours after injury, the blood volume and electrolyte balance needs to be maintained.\\nNext, the diet must help to resist infection, ensure healing, restore muscular strength and avoid\\n\\nweight loss.\\nNutrients Needed: (a)  Sufficient protein and calories to meet the above-mentioned needs\\n(b)  In case of fracture, additional calcium and vit. D need to be provided\\n(c)  Intakes of Vit. B complex be increased in proportion to increase in calories and protein\\n(d)  Vits. A and C to ensure wound healing and prevent infection\\nIntake of drinks providing high protein and calories between meals ensure adequate nutrient\\n\\nintake and utilization. The mode of feeding  - oral, tube feeding or parenteral route – depends upon the\\nseverity and location of the injury. (Refer to Chapter 24  for details of diets).\\n\\nSurgery\\n\\nIt is good to remember that to aid recovery from surgery, nutritional support is necessary.\\nSome illnesses need surgery as a corrective measure, for example, appendicitis, removal of\\n\\ninfected part, etc. Prior to surgery, the patient may have lost appetite due to illness or may have had\\nrestricted food intake. If there has been vomiting or diarrhea or loss of blood, these may result in losses\\nof sodium, potassium chloride, iron in addition to fluid loss.\\n\\nPrior to the operation, the patient is expected to fast. After operation, the patient may be given\\nonly clear-liquid diet. Thus the nutritional leak is further aggravated.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Stress, Burns and Surgery 347\\n\\nNutritional Considerations\\n\\nThe most critical factor is protein status of the patient. It is known that the stress of surgery will\\nincrease protein losses for several days after surgery. So the patient is likely to be in negative nitrogen\\nbalance.\\n\\nNutrients needed are:\\n\\n(a) Proteins for wound healing, to ensure resistance to infection and  to protect liver from\\ntoxicity of anaesthesia.\\n\\n(b) Energy to maintain or restore desirable weight, spare proteins.\\n(c) Ascorbic acid supplements to ensure wound healing.\\n(d) Iron supplements or transfusions to cover blood loss.\\n(e) Zinc supplements to promote wound healing and cell-mediated immunity.\\nIf nutritional status prior to surgery is improved, the surgical risk is reduced. If the patient is\\n\\nunderweight, weight gain may be beneficial. Likewise, weight loss may improve the status of obese\\npatients. However, rapid loss is not recommended as it may result in tissue breakdown.\\n\\nHence post-operative nutritional care assumes great importance. A 30 to 50 per cent increase in\\ncalorie and protein intake above maintenance level is needed to help gain weight if the patient is\\nunderweight.\\n\\nPostoperative Diet: After a minor surgery, liquids may be tolerated within few hours and return\\nto normal diet is rapid. In other cases, when peristalsis resumes, patients are progressively given ice\\nchips, sips of water, a clear liquid, full liquid, soft and then normal diet. The diet is similar to that given\\nin Tables 24.3  and 24.4. The rate of progression is dependent on the patient’s condition and tolerance\\nof food. If the patient is unable to take food orally or is not able to eat sufficient food, it is necessary to\\nresort to tube feeding or parenteral feeding.\\n\\nIf a patient is dehydrated,, it is important to ensure rehydration, before planning   surgery.\\nIf the surgery is minor, a deficient intake for a few days may not pose a serious problem. But if\\n\\nthe person is nutritionally depleted and has to undergo a major surgery, the matter may be serious.\\nTherefore screening persons on admission to identify those at nutritional risk is very important.\\n\\nSpecific Surgery\\n\\nThough the basic dietary needs of all surgery patients are similar in each case, attention to some\\nspecific aspects helps to ensure comfort of the patient.\\n\\nTeeth:  the diet is restricted to liquids (cool), followed by soft foods for multiple tooth extractions\\nTonsillectomy: After the operation, cold bland food, low-fibre foods are given followed by soft\\n\\nfoods, not too hot or cold and then to regular normal diet.\\nGastrectomy: Removal of part or all of the stomach and vagotomy (cutting of the vagus nerve\\n\\nto relieve pain). In gastric cancer and sometimes for intractable peptic ulcer, part or all of the\\nstomach(gastrectomy) and the vagus nerve (vagotomy) are removed surgically. Digestion of proteins\\nand fats, absorption of iron, vit. B12 is adversely affected. In absence of vagus nerve, food flow\\nthrough gastrointestinal tract is increased  and diarrhea and steatorrhea are likely to occur. These\\nproblems result in the patient losing weight.\\n\\nHence diet modifications are a must to cope with these problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n348 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nDietary Modifications: 60-90 ml clear liquids are given each hour, after gastrectomy for first\\ntwo days. A full-liquid or very low residue diet is allowed by third day. Vit. B12 is given by injection.\\nSince tolerance is low, foods are introduced one by one, meals are very small and frequent. The order\\nof introduction of foods is as follows:\\n\\n(1) Cereals, milk, cream soups, fruit, purees, eggs, custards.\\n(2) Cottage cheese, pureed vegetables, tender chicken (in non-vegetarian diet)\\nFoods included should be rich in proteins, moderate in fat and low in sugars. Fluids are given\\n\\nbetween meals.\\n\\nDumping Syndrome\\nThis is one of the problems faced by some patients after gastrectomy. This is mainly due to\\n\\ninappropriate composition of diet, with sugars being used as a CHO source. These patients suffer from\\nnausea, weakness, sweating and faintness soon after eating. They often suffer from diarrhea, vomiting\\nand lose weight. Due to absence of stomach, foods enter into the intestines directly. The water from\\nblood circulation is tied up by the large amount of carbohydrates present and blood volume is reduced.\\nThis results in the symptoms given above.\\n\\nThe diet for this condition is given in Table 34.1. Intake of bulking agents before meals helps to\\nslow intestinal motility.\\n\\nTable 34-1  High Protein, Moderate Fat, Low CHO Diet\\n\\nDiet Pattern\\nInclude 100-120g complex CHO daily\\nAvoid simple sugars, syrups, sweet desserts etc.\\nInclude liberal protein and moderate fat.\\nTake 6 small meals regularly every day. Take liquids 30-60 minutes after meals. Avoid\\nvery hot or very cold food\\nEat slowly, chew food well and rest before and after meals\\nInclude vitamins and mineral supplements\\nPlan the diet to suit individuals e.g. some patients cannot tolerate milk.\\n\\nFoods allowed each day\\nEgg-1, soft or hard cooked, scrambled or poached.\\nLow fat milk: 300 ml, if tolerated  - take ½ - 1 hr after meals\\nDals : Mung, masur, cooked  - 50 g.\\nFish, Poultry, Meat: all kinds, baked, boiled (not fried), stewed – 8 oz.\\nChapati – 1 chapati per meal or 1 slice enriched bread per meal\\nBread substitutes: rice, boiled or mashed potato or sweet potato, spaghetti, macaroni\\nnoodles\\nCereal: one serving\\nVegetables: all kinds one serving per meal\\nFruits: fresh, one serving per meal\\nFruit juices  between meals\\nFats: butter, cream, oil\\nNuts: if tolerated\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition in Stress, Burns and Surgery 349\\n\\nIn conclusion, surgery, burns, fevers and infections are traumas which lead to increased pace of\\nmetabolism in the body. Thus there is a need for increased supply of nutrients in the diet. At the same\\ntime, the injury causes a loss of nutrients from the body.\\n\\nTherefore, the diet must be modified to provide extra fluid, proteins, energy, vitamins and minerals\\nas required in these conditions. When surgery is preplanned or elective, the nutritional status must be\\nimproved before surgery. When food cannot be taken orally, enteral or parenteral nutrition should be\\nused.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. What is stress? How are nutritional needs affected by stress?\\n2. Discuss the various degrees of burns and the nutritional care of the patient with burns.\\n3. What is accidental injury and how are the nutritional needs of the patient met?\\n4. Discuss the nutritional needs of a patient who has undergone surgery.\\n5. What is a dumping syndrome?\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 35\\n\\nNutrition: Addictive Behaviours in Anorexia\\n\\nNervosa, Bulimia and Alcoholism\\n\\nDefinition\\n\\nEating Disorders\\nAnorexia Nervosa: Causes, Symptoms,\\nTreatment, Nutrition Therapy\\nBulimia Nervosa: Diet for Bulimics\\n\\nAlcoholism:  Effects of Alcohol Intake, Diet, Complications\\nInteractions of Alcohol and Nutrition, Nutrition Therapy\\n\\nDefinitions\\n\\nAddictive behaviours are compulsive ways of living (eating, drinking, etc.). Anorexia nervosa and\\nBulimia are addictive behaviours related to food intake, while alcoholism is the result of addiction to\\nalcohol and alcoholic drinks. There are no simple causes or solutions to eating and drinking disorders.\\nEach case has to be studied and the patient helped to normalcy with patience and perseverance.\\n\\nThough eating disorders have been known since the Middle Ages, the incidence of eating disorders\\nis on the rise in the developed countries. One of the contributing factors is the breakdown of social\\nstructure resulting in isolation of individuals. Luckily there is hardly any report of these in India, but one\\nneeds to watch and prevent these, as the treatment and rehabilitation of persons suffering from eating\\ndisorders is very slow and expensive.\\n\\nThe incidence of alcoholism is on the increase in all strata of population in India. It needs to be\\nstemmed as it affects the well being of the whole family adversely\\n\\nAll these disorders result in the deterioration of the nutritional status of the person; therefore\\nnutritional rehabilitation of the patient is a very important part of therapy.\\n\\nEating Disorders\\n\\nAnorexia nervosa  implies loss of appetite. It can aptly be described as denying one’s appetite.\\nIn USA one per cent girls in the age range of 12 to 18 years suffer from it. Its occurrence in males and\\nadults is not common. Girls whose profession demands maintaining ultra slim figures  (such as models,\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition: Addictive Behaviours in Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia and Alcoholism 351\\n\\ndancers, athletes) have long standing histories of eating disorders. Bulimia means “ox-hunger” or\\nbeing as hungry as an ox. The persons suffering from bulimia go on a eating binge often and feel guilty.\\nSo they try to get rid of the food by forced vomiting, fasting, taking diuretics or using laxatives. They\\nkeep their binge –purge behaviour a secret and hence it is difficult to identify the disorder until the\\nstress of these episodes results in some visible impact on the system. Even male athletes( runners,\\nwrestlers, swimmers, etc.) and pilots also resort to binge-purge practices.\\n\\nCauses: Addictive behaviours have multiple causes – emotional, psychological, social and\\nbiological, which result in disordered eating. Stress may have a strong role and lack of appropriate\\ncoping mechanism is another common factor.\\n\\nSymptoms of Anorexia Nervosa: The anorectic patient is often 20 to 40 per cent below desirable\\nweight for the age and stature and appears to be skin and bones. Other symptoms are lowered body\\ntemperature, slower basal metabolism, decreased heart rate (hence easy fatigue, fainting, sleepiness),\\niron-deficiency anemia, rough dry scaly and cold skin from a poor nutrient intake, low white blood cell\\ncount (increasing risk of infection and death), loss of hair, constipation (and laxative abuse), loss of\\nmenstrual periods and deterioration of teeth due to frequent vomiting, An anorectic person is\\npsychologically and physically ill and needs help.\\n\\nTreatment of Anorexia Nervosa: The patient is often a victim of isolation and fear. Hence the\\nhealth team must include a psychologist in addition to a physician, dietitian and other health personnel.\\nThey should all work together to restore a sense of balance, purpose and future with the cooperation of\\nthe patient. The first step is to help the patient to gain weight, as a psychiatrist cannot counsel a\\nstarving person.\\n\\nNutrition Therapy: The first step is to increase the person’s food intake. This will help to stop\\nweight loss and may help weight gain. The next is to restore regular food habits. The third is to ensure\\nthat the patient keeps in weekly contact with the dietitian. In all this it is critical to allow the person to\\nfeel in control of her life in the early stage of treatment. There should be no surprises, as these may be\\ndetrimental to progress. Anorectics are very clever and resistant. They try to disguise weight loss or\\nfake weight gain by wearing many layers of clothes, putting coins in the pocket and drinking a lot of\\nwater before weighing. One needs to gain their trust to be able to help them.\\n\\nThe nutritional rehabilitation is slow. The nutritional care consists of going through the stages of\\nliquid to soft to full diet. (refer to Chapter 23)\\n\\nThe mode of feeding will depend on the condition of the patient. It is important to educate the\\npatient and help her/his family. Some points to note in the treatment of anorectics are:\\n\\n1. Patients need to be given intravenous feedings to restore fluid and electrolyte balance, when\\nthe patient is in a critical state and is likely to get dehydrated.\\n\\n2. When patient’s nutritional state is precarious, give peripheral parenteral nutrition to support\\noral intake.\\n\\n3. Get patients to be partners in the efforts to restore satisfactory nutritional status; attain\\nnormal weight and develop normal eating patterns.\\n\\n4. Anorectics are intelligent patients. Educate them about their normal growth pattern and the\\nintake to meet the needs for their growth. This will enable them to set goals to attain their\\nnormal growth gradually.\\n\\n5. Lastly avoid food being the centre point of their day. They need to take interest in recreational\\nactivities – music, games, reading, enjoying family company, making friends etc. to get back\\nto enjoying normal life of which food is an important part.\\n\\n\\n\\n352 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nBulimia Nervosa\\n\\nAn increasing number of youngsters, especially females (models, actresses, dancers, athletes and\\nothers) go through stages of eating large amounts of foods (high fat sweets) and then get rid of it by\\nvomiting. This disorder is called bulimia nervosa. Bulemics may eat 3,000 to 5,000 calories in one\\nextended binge and then vomit to get rid of it. With repeated episodes, they may have chloride and\\npotassium deficiencies, which may lead to heart damage and other complications.\\n\\nBulemics suffer from low self-esteem and depression. It is necessary to help a bulemic develop\\nself-esteem through understanding self worth, develop a positive attitude, learn to take pleasure in\\nsimple activities (listening to music, reading, writing, drawing, sewing, knitting, gardening, playing\\ngames, etc.) and avoid depressing inactivity. Most bulemics have irregular food habits and they may be\\nunderweight and undernourished.\\n\\nDiet for Bulemics\\n\\nBulemics need to understand about effects of starvation on the body, their nutrient needs and how\\nto meet these through planned diet modification. Bulemics need to recognise that their primary aim is\\nthe stabilization of their body weight without having to go through binging and purging, which disturbs\\nand hurts the body’s well being. Some points to note in their treatment are:\\n\\n1. Help patients to understand and plan a diet  which meets their normal nutritional  needs. The\\nactual calorie expenditure needs are determined by measuring oxygen consumption.\\n\\n2. Plan the diet using basic food guide. (Chapter 23, Table 23.1).  The foods thus selected meet\\nthe mineral and vitamins needs (refer to Table 23.1). Hence  supplements are not necessary.\\n\\n3. The patient can be helped to select a varied diet, after taking her likes and dislikes into\\naccount.\\n\\n4. Teach how to measure or weigh foods to give confidence that there will be no over- eating.\\n5. Personalized meal plans (3 meals + snacks) with wide variety of foods helps acceptance.\\n6. Avoid excessive bulk in the initial stages to have a third of stomach empty.\\n7. Gradually increase intake by 200 calories until the norm is reached.\\n8. Avoid fasting, skipping meals and eating inadequate amounts at a meal as it leads to binges.\\n\\nKeep food record.\\nThese measures help to develop confidence in themselves and make them self-reliant in managing\\n\\ntheir diet.\\n\\nAlcoholism\\n\\nPeople offer beverages to companions in social gatherings. Some people choose alcohol over\\nother beverages such as juice, coffee, tea, soft drinks or milk. For some of these people, alcohol use\\nbecomes a life-shattering addiction, alcoholism, which leads to severe malnutrition, physical illness and\\nerosion or loss of self-esteem.\\n\\nPersistent intake of amounts of alcohol that exceed the daily permitted levels indicates a dependence\\nthat needs to be recognized as addiction and dealt with.\\n\\nAlcoholism is a major chronic disease. It is also a major social problem which afflicts a large\\nsection of society, irrespective of economic status. It accounts for more than half of fatal car accidents.\\nAs the drinker gets abusive, violent and/or incapable, the effects of alcoholism on the family are\\n\\n\\n\\nNutrition: Addictive Behaviours in Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia and Alcoholism 353\\n\\ndevastating. The help of an outside agency such as Alcoholics Anonymous is needed to help\\nrehabilitation. However, for such help to have any success, the addict needs to admit that she/he has a\\nproblem and really wants to give up drinking. Until she/he reaches that point and starts to co-operate in\\nrehabilitation, the life of the family can be of unbearable misery.\\n\\nEffect of Alcohol Intake\\nAlcoholic beverages contain ethanol, which liberates 7.1 kcal/g.. If it replaces half the intake of\\n\\nfood in a balanced diet, it results in malnutrition and malfunction. Chronic alcohol consumption may\\nalter digestion and absorption of food. Ethanol disrupts the gastric mucosal barrier and causes acute\\ngastritis. Massive bleeding and hence iron deficiency may accompany acute gastritis. Alcohol may\\nincrease acid secretion. Intake of excessive alcohol (1g/ kg) results in lesions in the duodenum and\\nfunctional changes in the small intestines. This may give rise to diarrhea, malabsorption of  folate,\\nthiamine, B12, fat and xylose, changes in pancreatic secretion and bile salt metabolism.\\n\\nThe most significant complication in alcoholics is liver disease (fatty liver. hepatitis and cirrhosis)\\nwhich aggravates the malnourished state. The second organ affected is heart leading to heart disease.\\nBeriberi may result due to thiamine deficiency. Deficiencies of pyridoxine and folate may result in\\nabnormalities in blood synthesis. The nervous disorders result in decreased fine movements. Besides\\nthiamine, deficiency of other B vitamins may also lead to these disorders.\\n\\nThe success of nutritional therapy depends on two points. The first is removal of the cause –\\nabstinence from alcohol. The second is nutritional care of the patient to reverse the organ damage to\\nensure healing and regain normal function.\\n\\nAlcoholic fatty liver is the earliest stage of liver injury. This is a completely reversible stage.\\nAbstinence from alcohol and specific therapy for nutritional deficiencies helps recovery.\\n\\nDiet, which provides normal protein low fat and extra vitamins, remains the mainstay of the\\ntreatment. Several times the daily requirements of water soluble vitamins are given. Sufficient calorie\\nintake is necessary to prevent the breakdown of proteins in the body. One indicator of calorie sufficiency\\nis weight gain, if the patient is underweight, and weight maintenance, if the patient has not lost weight\\ndue to excess alcohol intake,\\n\\nComplications: When the patient has neuropsychiatric symptoms, she/he may need hospitalisation\\nto ensure abstinence and special nutritional care.\\n\\nIn case of ascites and edema, dietary intake and salt restriction will need to be monitored according\\nto the severity of the condition. In extreme cases, sodium may be restricted to 250 mg per day. As the\\nseverity decreases, sodium intake may be increased to 500 mg or more per day.\\n\\nNeurologic disorders in the alcoholic include peripheral neuropathy, in which thiamine B12,\\npyridoxine, nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid and riboflavin deficiencies are associated. It is treated with\\nabstinence and B-vitamin therapy. Though optimal dosage is not established, one recommendation is 10\\ntimes the normal requirement for 1 week and 5 times the daily needs after that.\\n\\nIron deficiency in the alcoholic needs to be treated cautiously. In patients with liver disease,\\nexcess iron may lead to liver damage. The patient may respond simply to abstinence and vitamin\\nsupplementation.\\n\\nIn case of beri-beri heart disease, thiamine repletion of 5 to 10 mg per day is likely to be sufficient,\\nalong with adequate diet and alcohol abstinence.\\n\\nThe interactions of alcohol and nutrition are presented in Table 35.1. Thus multiple nutrient\\ndeficiencies result from reduced food intake and interference with nutrient use in the body.\\n\\n\\n\\n354 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nTable 35.1  Effects of Alcohol Intake on Nutrition\\n\\n1. Alcohol is empty calories, it displaces food, hence nutrients.\\n2. Alcohol reduces food intake resulting in inadequate nutrient intake.\\n3. Alcohol disrupts every tissue’s metabolism of nutrients.\\n\\n(i) Stomach cells over-secrete both acid and histamine (which causes inflammation);\\nextra acid may cause ulcers in stomach  and esophagus linings.\\n\\n(ii) Intestinal cells fail to absorb thiamin, folate, Vit. B6 and other vitamins.\\n(iii) Liver cells lose efficiency in activating Vit. D and change their synthesis and  elimination\\n\\nof bile.\\n(iv) Retinal cells process alcohol instead of  Vit. A alcohol (retinoal) thus damaging vision\\n(v) Kidneys excrete essential ,minerals (magnesium, calcium, potassium  and zinc) thus\\n\\ncreating deficiency of these minerals.\\n4. Alcohol metabolites interfere with Vit. B6 metabolism and thus reduce RB cells production.\\n5. Excessive alcohol expels folate from of all its sites of action and storage. Thus liver storage\\n\\nof folate is leaked to blood to kidneys. Blood is excreted from the kidneys.  Intestines fail to\\nretrieve folate leading to folate deficiency. This inhibits synthesis of new intestinal and\\nblood cells.\\n\\nNutrition Therapy: Patients treated for alcohol addiction need simultaneous optimal nutrition\\ntherapy to reverse nutritional deficiencies that occur. These include night blindness (Vit. A)), beriberi,\\n(thiamine), pellagra (niacin), scurvy (Vit. C) and protein-energy-malnutrition. Therefore there is a need\\nfor adequate intake to ensure recovery of the patient.\\n\\nStudy Questions\\n\\n1. What are addictive behaviours?\\n2. Discuss the symptoms and the points to note in the treatment of an anoretic.\\n3. What are the important points to note while treating bulimics?\\n4.

But some drugs may have adverse\\neffect on the utilisation of some nutrients. So it is necessary to  understand their relationship and\\nmaximise their utility by judicious planning.\\n\\nInteraction between diet and drugs is significant in\\n(a) Those who need long term drug therapy.\\n(b) Those who are malnourished.\\n(c) Those suffering from chronic diseases.\\n(d) Those who have undergone surgery.\\n(e) Those who are obese\\n(f) High-risk segments of population\\nInteractions of frequently used drugs with nutrients are given in Table 36.1.\\n\\nHigh Risk Segments of Population\\n\\nThese include developing fetus, infants (especially premature ones), pregnant women, chronically\\nill persons and elderly persons.\\n\\n\\n\\n356 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nIn late pregnancy increased concentrations of the transport protein for most drugs results in drug\\nconcentration in the fetus.\\n\\nYoung children (including infants) have high requirements of nutrients per kg body weight; hence\\ndrugs that decrease absorption or increase excretion of a nutrient affects them adversely.\\n\\nMany elderly persons suffer from chronic diseases and have to take several drugs for prolonged\\nperiods. Their food intake is often inadequate. They may take wrong drugs at times. Thus this segment\\nof elderly need special assistance to avoid adverse nutrient drug interaction.\\n\\nSome commonly used drugs include analgesics (pain killers), cough, cold, sinus and allergy\\ndrugs, digestive aids, antacids, sleep aids (sedatives), appetite suppressants, diuretics, antibiotics  etc.\\nMany of these drugs are available without prescription. In addition, health enthusiasts take vitamin and\\nmineral pills in the belief, if a little is good, a higher amount may be better for health. These create a\\nscenario for an undesirable nutrient-drug interaction.\\n\\nNutrient Absorption\\n\\nMost nutrients and drugs are absorbed in the small intestine. Hence it is the major site for nutrient-\\ndrug intervention.\\n\\nThe absorption of nutrients may be adversely affected by drugs, if the transit time is altered.\\nLaxatives tend to reduce nutrient absorption by reducing the transit time. If the pH of stomach contents\\nis increased due to drugs (e.g. antacids), the absorption of iron, calcium, zinc and folates is reduced.\\n\\nFat and fat-soluble vitamins are poorly absorbed, when drugs are taken to reduce cholesterol by\\nthe patient; neomycin (an antibiotic) has the same effect.\\n\\nHigh doses of antacids  (aluminium or magnesium hydroxide) can cause phosphate depletion,\\nleading to muscle weakness, loss of appetite (anorexia) and even congestive heart failure. Diuretics\\n(thiazide and furosemide) can cause sodium, potassium and magnesium depletion leading to loss of\\nappetite and muscle weakness.\\n\\nDrug Absorption\\n\\nA drug is a chemical, which interacts with the metabolic process in the body to bring about a\\ndesirable effect. Drug action can occur only after it is dissolved, carried to the target site and absorbed.\\nAbout 75 per cent of oral drugs will generally be absorbed in 1 to 3 hours.\\n\\nThe metabolism of many drugs and a variety of foreign compounds is carried out by the mixed-\\nfunction-oxidase system (MFOS). Almost all nutrients are components of the MFO system. These\\ninclude proteins, lipids, B-complex vitamins (nicotinic acid, riboflavin and pantothenic acid), fat soluble\\nvitamins (A and E) and minerals (iron, copper, calcium, zinc and magnesium).\\n\\nWhen food enters the stomach, the gastric pH is lowered by dilution and stomach emptying is\\ndelayed. These factors may reduce the absorption rate and hence the effectiveness of the drugs. In\\nview of this, it is advisable to take pain relievers (analgesics), fever reducing drugs (antipyretics),\\nantiinfectives for acute infections and antihistamines on an empty stomach for rapid recovery. Aspirin\\nand antibiotics are also better absorbed in a fasting state.\\n\\nAlmost a billion dollars is spent each year in the United States of America on antacids, making\\nthese products among the most popular over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. These tablets and liquids are\\ngulped down for the relief of heartburn, sour stomach and indigestion. Antacids may also be prescribed\\nto treat stomach ulcers.\\n\\n\\n\\nNutritent Drug Interaction 357\\n\\nAlthough many consumers take antacids almost casually, these drugs are not as harmless as they\\nmay seem. Antacids can affect the way other drugs behave in the body. They can speed the absorption\\nof some prescription drugs, possibly causing an overdose, or slow it for others thus reducing their\\neffectiveness.\\n\\nSome nutrients and food components can decrease food absorption and hence its effectiveness.\\nThese include amino acids from high protein diet, dairy products and iron from iron supplements.\\n\\nTherefore, it is advisable to time intake of food and drugs at appropriate intervals, since one needs\\nboth for proper recovery.\\n\\nEffect of Drugs on Food Intake\\n\\nFood intake is affected by drugs taken by the patient. The effects can include decrease or increase\\nin appetite and taste, nausea and vomiting. For example, antacids, caffeine, cough medicines,\\nantihistamines can decrease appetite.\\n\\nDrugs taken to reduce weight are intended to reduce appetite. But their effectiveness is reduced\\nrapidly. Hence their utility in weight reduction regimen is limited.\\n\\nAntibiotics and many chemotherapy agents (for cancer) may cause diarrhea or vomiting and thus\\nreduce food intake.\\n\\nSome drugs may be a source of nutrients which may not be appropriate for some patients. For\\nexample, cough medications may contain sugar; antibiotics and antacids may contain sodium.\\n\\nNutrient Metabolism\\n\\nSome drugs used as anticonvulsants may cause calcium loss and folate deficiency. Calcium loss\\nmay lead to osteomalacia on prolonged use of anticonvulsants. Hence the need for nutrient supplements\\nwith these drugs. In contrast, the effectiveness of some drugs such as levadopa and coumarin is\\nreduced due to vitamin supplements (pyridoxine and vitamin K) respectively.\\n\\nSome drugs block enzymatic action involved in DNA synthesis and thus lead to the death of a\\ncell. This is the principle used in the chemotherapy of cancer.\\n\\nTwo common antivitamins, used as drugs, are the folate antagonists, methotrexate (MRX) (used\\nin the treatment of leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis) and pyrimethamine (used in the treatment of\\nmalaria and ocular toxoplasmosis). These drugs displace folic acid from the related enzyme and the\\nunbound folic acid is excreted. In the absence of folic acid, DNA synthesis is inhibited, cell synthesis\\nstops and the cell dies. Isoniazid, which is used in the long-term treatment of TB, forms a complex\\nwith the B-vitamin, pyridoxine, which may lead to its deficiency in some patients. Anticoagulants used\\nin treatment are intentional vitamin K antagonists. The acidity of the gastrointestinal tract also affects\\ndrug disposition. A more acidic environment reduces the availability of penicillin and isoniazid but\\nincreases the absorption of tetracyclines. Food decreases, delays or enhances the absorption of some\\nantibiotics.\\n\\nAlcohol\\n\\nAlcohol is not prescribed as a drug. But it is a chemical, which affects nutrition in many ways. It\\nyields 7 calories/gramme, but not much of other nutrient. It is a habit-forming drink; hence its use is\\nbest avoided.\\n\\n\\n\\n358 Fundamentals of Foods, Nutrition and Diet Therapy\\n\\nAlcohol can cause nausea and thus decrease appetite. Alcohol abuse commonly results in\\ndeficiencies of thiamin, folate, vitamin B6, vit. A and zinc.\\n\\nCaffeine\\n\\nCaffeine, an addictive chemical, is present in tea, coffee, soft drinks and chocolates, which are\\nconsumed by all age groups. It is reported that an average healthy person can take moderate amounts\\nof caffeine without any harmful effects.\\n\\nAn intake of 1000mg/day or more of caffeine can cause diarrhea, headache, heartburn and\\nsleeplessness.\\n\\nEven in smaller amounts, caffeine can act as a diuretic. It can also increase a basal metabolic rate\\nand heart rate.\\n\\nMore than 1000 over-the-counter drugs, which need no prescription, contain caffeine. These\\ndrugs include those used to increase alertness and avoid sleepiness, headache and cold remedies and\\neven weight-control drugs.\\n\\nIt is important to note that caffeine does not reverse the effects of alcohol, as it is commonly\\nbelieved and hence does not help in ‘sobering up’ after excessive  intake of alcohol.\\n\\nMAOI Inhibitors\\n\\nThe most harmful drug-nutrient interaction is the one between the enzyme Monoamine Oxidase\\nInhibitors and blood-pressure elevating (pressor) amines, especially tyramine.\\n\\nMAOI (Monamine Oxidase inhibitors) are used as drugs. These include antidepressants,\\nantimicrobials, antineoplastics and antihypertesnsive drugs.\\n\\nNormally, the enzyme MAO  (Monoamine Oxidase) inactivates the pressor agents and thus prevents\\nthe release of excess of norepinephrine, a hormone. The MAOIs block this reaction and the levels of\\nnorepinephrine rise unchecked. This can lead to reactions such as headaches, hypertension, palpitations\\netc. Major strokes have been reported in extreme cases. The severity of reaction is affected by the\\ndosage of the drug and the level of dietary tyramine.\\n\\nThe tyramine content of foods is increased by aging ( as in fermentation or spoilage). Hence it is\\nbest to take fresh foods in diet, when a person is on MAOI therapy. It is also advisable to avoid foods\\nstored for long periods and those likely to have bacterial contamination. Alteration to restrict tyramine\\nin the diet must be made some days before starting MAOI therapy and be continued for 3 – 4 weeks\\nafter the therapy.\\n\\nPrecautions to be taken\\n\\nThe unrestricted buying and ingestion of drugs bought over the counter is a cause of concern in\\ndeveloping countries like India where there is little supervision of the sale of drugs, especially for those\\nneeding a medical doctor’s prescription. Nutrient absorption can be reduced in such situations and in\\nextreme cases may lead to incompatability reactions endangering life. This is more so with elderly\\npersons as they are prone to taking drugs for various ailments.\\n\\nIn conclusion to quote Sizer and Whitney (1997)(1) “ When you need to take a medicine, do so\\nwisely.

As for smoking and chewing tobacco, the same advice applies: don’t take these habits up, or\\nif you already have, take steps to quit. For drugs with lesser consequences to health, such as caffeine,\\nuse moderation.\\n\\nTry to live life in a way that requites less chemical assistance. If sleepy, try a 15-minute nap or\\nmeditation instead of a 15-minute coffee break.

(AIIMS)\\n\\nIt is a group of foods of the same caloric value and similar protein, fat and carbohydrate content\\nthat can be substituted for one another in a meal plan. Foods have been divided into six groups of\\nexchanges. Any one of the exchange groups cannot by itself supply all the needed nutrients for a well-\\nbalanced diet. It requires all six of them put together as a team to supply the normal nutritional needs for\\ngood health. The six major exchanges are:\\n\\n1. Milk exchange\\n2. Vegetable exchange\\n3. Fruit exchange\\n4. Cereals and pulses exchange\\n5. Meat exchange\\n6. Fat exchange\\n\\nMilk Exchange\\n\\n1.
